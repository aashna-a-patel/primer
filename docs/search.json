    "text": "1.1 Predictive model\nHave you ever wondered what the world would be like without you?\nIn the classic film “It’s a Wonderful Life,” the protagonist, George Bailey, finds himself in a state of despair, convinced that his life has been meaningless. The movie takes the audience on a journey alongside George as he is granted a glimpse into an alternate reality—a world in which he had never existed. Through this experience, it becomes evident that George’s life had a significant and positive impact on the lives of countless individuals within his community. His selfless actions and kind-hearted nature had touched the lives of many, leaving an indelible mark that he had never fully appreciated. The film serves as a poignant reminder that our lives, no matter how seemingly ordinary, have the power to make a profound difference in the world around us.\nBy showing what the world would have been like without George, we get an idea of the causal effect of his life on his town and the people who live there. This chapter explains causation using the framework of potential outcomes and the Rubin Causal Model (RCM).\nWe begin by discussing predictive versus causal models in data science. In both cases, a Preceptor Table and a Population Table provide analytic tools for attacking the problem. Assumptions concerning validity, stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness are critical.\nWe would not need data science if we (and our bosses, colleagues, and clients) did not have questions. Every data science project starts with a question. Examples:\nWhat is the average height of a student at New College of Florida?\nWhat are the chances that, out of the next four New College students we meet, one will be taller than 183 centimeters?\nA predictive model involves exactly one outcome which, in this case, is height. Of course, there are many other variables associated with college students: weight, sex, age, family income, GPA, et cetera. These questions, however, are about height, a variable which is fixed, meaning that each individual has only one possible value for height, at least for the purpose of these questions.",

    "text": "1.1.1 Preceptor Table\nA Preceptor Table1 is the smallest possible table with rows and columns such that, if none of the data is missing, then the things we want to know are easy to calculate. Consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcome\n\n\n\nHeight (cm)\n\n\n\n\nStudent 1\n190\n\n\nStudent 2\n160\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\nStudent 47\n172\n\n\nStudent 48\n176\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\nStudent 325\n180\n\n\nStudent 326\n162\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\nStudent 670\n185\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we had a table with the height of every New College student, then statistics like the average would be easy to calculate. It would also be straightforward, using simulation, to estimate the chances of various scenarios, as in our second question.\nConstructing the Preceptor Table is sometimes tricky. The question(s) we start with help us to identify the “units,” “outcome,” and “covariates” which describe the structure of the table. The “units” refer to the rows, which are the individual students at New College. Different question(s) would require different units. The “outcome” refers to height, the key variable which is the focus of the question(s).\nEven the simplest Preceptor Table will have two columns. The first is an ID column which serves to label each unit. The second column is the outcome of interest, the variable we are trying to predict/understand/influence. The rows of the Preceptor Table are the units, the objects on which the outcome is measured.\nHowever, if we had different questions, then we would need a different Preceptor Table. Consider:\nWhat is the average height of a female student at New College of Florida?\nWhat are the chances that, out of the next four male New College students we meet, one will be taller than 183 centimeters?\nThe Preceptor Table for the first set of questions did not require a column for sex because we did not need that information to answer those questions. For these new questions, we do:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcome\n\n\nCovariate\n\n\n\nHeight (cm)\nSex\n\n\n\n\nStudent 1\n190\nMale\n\n\nStudent 2\n160\nFemale\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nStudent 47\n172\nFemale\n\n\nStudent 48\n176\nFemale\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nStudent 325\n180\nMale\n\n\nStudent 326\n162\nFemale\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nStudent 670\n185\nMale\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovariates are the variables, other than the outcome, which we need to answer our question(s).\n\n1.1.2 Data\nSadly, in the real world, we almost never have a complete Preceptor Table with no missing data. After all, if our boss/client/colleague had that, they would not have needed to call us! Instead, we have some data. Consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData for New College Students\n\n\nID\n\nOutcome\n\n\n\nHeight (cm)\n\n\n\n\nStudent 11\n160\n\n\nStudent 32\n189\n\n\nStudent 47\n172\n\n\nStudent 68\n170\n\n\nStudent 425\n175\n\n\nStudent 436\n162\n\n\nStudent 570\n188\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that, if this is the only data we have, then we can’t answer the second set of questions because our data does not include any information about sex. And that is OK! There are many situations in which the data we have access to is not enough to answer the questions which we have.\nThe notion of time is important, both in our Preceptor Table and in our data. To what moment in time do the questions refer? At what moment in time was our data collected? Those two moments are almost always different. Our data comes from some point in the past, even if it was collected yesterday. Our questions usually refer to now or to an indeterminate moment in the future. Implicit in both the Preceptor Table and the data is a “time” column, even if it is not actually present. The times almost always differ between Preceptor Table and data.\nIn order to use this data to answer our questions, we need to consider the concept of validity. Is the data we have valid for answering our questions? Height, as an outcome, seems to make this simple, but, even here, complications can arise. For example, was height measured with shoes on or off? Which measure do we want? Validity is the consistency, or lack there of, in the columns of our data set and the corresponding columns in our Preceptor Table. If validity holds — if “height” means close enough to the same thing in both sources — we can combine the Preceptor Table with our data to construct the Population Table.\n\n1.1.3 Population Table\nWe create the Population Table2 by combining the Preceptor Table and the data. The aim of the Population Table is to illustrate the broader population in which we are interested. This table has three sources of data: the data for units we want to have (the Preceptor Table), the data for units which we actually have (our data), and the data for units we do not care about (the rest of the population, not included in the data or the Preceptor Table).\nWe are trying to answer questions about the height of New College students in 2025, so the “Year” entries for these rows will read “2025.” In this case, the actual data comes from a survey of New College students in 2015.\nWe drop the ID column since we do not need it to answer our questions.\nThe “Source” column refers to the source of the rows in the Population Table. The rows with no “Source” are from the larger population from which, by assumption, both the Preceptor Table and the data are drawn. As such, all values, other than year, are missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Table\n\n\nSource\nYear\nHeight\n\n\n\n\n…\n2010\n…\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nData\n2015\n180\n\n\nData\n2015\n163\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n…\n2018\n…\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n2025\n?\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n2025\n?\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n…\n2030\n…\n\n\n…\n2030\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe question marks indicate the data which we do not know but which we need in order to answer the questions. The ellipses are data we don’t know and don’t need to know.\nBy definition, our population covers both the data we have and the data we want to have: the Preceptor Table. That is to say that, given our data is sourced from 2015 and our desired data is from 2025, our population must span at least those years. But, obviously, it seems reasonable that the population goes both earlier and later than these endpoints. After all, we would probably use the same model even if our data came from 2010 instead of 2015 or if we had wanted to answer questions about 2030 instead of 2025.\nNever forget that time is always a lie in the Population Table. Indeed, any time variable is suspect in data science more broadly.\n\nA moment in time is rarely measured accurately. In this example, we refer to the data being recorded in 2015. But that isn’t true! We didn’t record student heights across a year. We recorded them once, on a specific date like August 9, 2015 and at a specific time like 3:16 PM.\nIdentical values often aren’t truly identical. Even though the data measures for different students all refer to 2015, they almost certainly occurred at different moments in time, even if all measurements were taken during the year 2015. In fact, measurements can and do occur on different days or even months. Using 2015 a the value for year hides that variation.\nThe value for the time variable for rows corresponding to the Preceptor Table is always hazy. Does it refer to now? Tomorrow? Whenever we finish the analysis? In general, we don’t know the time period for which we are answering our question until we actually get to the point of answering it.\n\n1.1.4 Assumptions\nValidity, as we have already discussed, is the consistency, or lack there of, in the columns of our data set and the corresponding columns in our Preceptor Table. In order to consider the two data sets to be drawn from the same population, the columns from one must have a valid correspondence with the columns in the other. Validity, if true (or at least reasonable), allows us to construct the Population Table. Fortunately, the height variable from each source, while perhaps not identical in meaning, are similar enough that we can treat them as if they are the same thing.\nStability means that the relationship between the columns in the Population Table is the same for three categories of rows: the data, the Preceptor Table, and the larger population from which both are drawn.\nIn the case of height, we might worry that the population of students at New College is different today than it was in 2015. For example, maybe there are more students from Denmark and Slovenia, two countries where people are taller, on average, than in the US. If so, then the stability assumption would not hold and we could not use our data from 2015 to make inferences about students in 2015.\nRepresentativeness, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationships among the rows in the Population Table. The first is between the Preceptor Table and the other rows. The second is between our data and the other rows. Ideally, we would like both the Preceptor Table and our data to be random samples from the population. Sadly, this is almost never the case.\nWith height among New College students, we might worry about the process by which our data was collected in 2015. If the students in the data were a random sample of all students, then representativeness would not be a concern. Random samples are representative, at least in expectation. But if, instead, the 2015 data was collected from students walking out of the gym, then that sample of students might not be representative of the population of New College students from 2010 to 2030 as a whole.\nUnconfounded is an assumption which only applies to causal models. We will discuss it below.\nWe started with some questions about the height of New College students. We created a Preceptor Table which, if it existed with no missing data, would allow us to answer those questions",

    "section": "\n1.2 Causal model",
    "text": "1.2 Causal model\nPredictive models are flexible enough to cover a wide range of questions. For example, Enos (2014) measured attitudes toward immigration among Boston commuters. Individuals were exposed to one of two possible conditions, and then their attitudes towards immigrants were recorded. One condition was waiting on a train platform near individuals speaking Spanish. The other was being on a train platform without Spanish-speakers.\n\n\n\n\nThis study, which shows the impact of exposure to Spanish-speaking individuals on attitudes towards immigration, was conducted by Ryan Enos.\n\n\n\nConsider two questions:\nWhat is the average attitude toward immigration of Boston commuters?\nWhat is the average attitude toward immigration of Boston commuters exposed to Spanish speakers on the train platform?\nTo answer these questions, we can use a Preceptor Table with the same format as the height/sex example from New College:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcome\n\n\nCovariate\n\n\n\nAttitude toward Immigration\nTreatment\n\n\n\n\nCommuter 1\n10\nTreated\n\n\nCommuter 2\n15\nControl\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nCommuter 47\n7\nControl\n\n\nCommuter 48\n5\nControl\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nCommuter 325\n10\nTreated\n\n\nCommuter 326\n9\nControl\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nCommuter N\n6\nTreated\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two Preceptor Tables have the same structure because the structure of the two problems is the same. In this case, the units are individual Boston commuters, the outcome is their attitude toward immigration (measured on a 3 to 15 integer scale), and the covariate is whether or not they were exposed to Spanish speakers (“treated”) on the train platform or not (“control”). If we had access to a Preceptor Table with no missing data, we could easily answer our questions. (Side note: the last commuter has an ID number N because we are not sure how many commuters there are.)\nThis is a predictive model, like the height one, because we assume that attitude toward immigration is fixed, conditional on the covariate value for treatment. We want to know what Commuter 1’s attitude is (10) and, to estimate that, we can use the fact that they were treated, i.e., exposed to Spanish speakers on the train platform. To answer our questions, we do not need to consider any counter-factuals. We do not need to know what Commuter 1’s attitude would have been if they had not been exposed to the Spanish speakers. To answer questions concerning such counter-factuals, we need to construct a causal model.\n\n1.2.1 Rubin Causal Model (RCM)\nThe Rubin Causal Model (RCM) is based on the idea of potential outcomes. To calculate the causal effect of having Spanish-speakers nearby, we need to compare the outcome for an individual in one possible state of the world (with Spanish-speakers) to the outcome for that same individual in another state of the world (without Spanish-speakers). However, it is impossible to observe both potential outcomes at once. One of the potential outcomes is always missing, since a unit cannot travel back in time, and experience both treatments. This dilemma is the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference.\nIn most circumstances, we are interested in comparing two experimental manipulations, one generally termed “treatment” and the other “control.” The difference between the potential outcome under treatment and the potential outcome under control is a “causal effect” or a “treatment effect.” According to the RCM, the causal effect of being on the platform with Spanish-speakers is the difference between what your attitude would have been under “treatment” (with Spanish-speakers) and under “control” (no Spanish-speakers).\nThe commuter survey consisted of three questions, each measuring agreement on a 1 to 5 integer scale, with 1 being liberal and 5 being conservative. For each person, the three answers were summed, generating an overall measure of attitude toward immigration which ranged from 3 (very liberal) to 15 (very conservative). If your attitude towards immigrants would have been a 13 after being exposed to Spanish-speakers and a 9 with no such exposure, then the causal effect of being on a platform with Spanish-speakers is a 4-point increase in your score.\nWe will use the symbol \\(Y\\) to represent potential outcomes, the variable we are interested in understanding and modeling. \\(Y\\) is called the response or outcome variable. It is the variable we want to “explain.” In our case this would be the attitude score. If we are trying to understand a causal effect, we need two symbols so that the value with treatment and the value with control can be represented separately: \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_c\\).\n\n1.2.2 Potential outcomes\nSuppose that Yao is one of the commuters surveyed in this experiment. If we were omniscient, we would know the outcomes for Yao under both treatment (with Spanish-speakers) and control (no Spanish-speakers), and we would be able to ignore the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference. We can show this using a Preceptor Table. Calculating the number we are interested in is trivial because none of the data is missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\n\nAttitude if Treated\nAttitude if Control\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nRegardless of what the causal effect is for other subjects, the causal effect for Yao of being on the train platform with Spanish-speakers is a shift towards a more conservative attitude.\nUsing the response variable — the actual symbol rather than a written description — makes for a more concise Preceptor Table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t\\]\n\\[Y_c\\]\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n9\n\n\n\n\n\nThe “causal effect” is the difference between Yao’s potential outcome under treatment and his potential outcome under control.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t\\]\n\\[Y_c\\]\n\\[Y_t - Y_c\\]\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n9\n+4\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that, in the real world, we will have a bunch of missing data! We can not use simple arithmetic to calculate the causal effect on Yao’s attitude toward immigration. Instead, we will be required to estimate it. An estimand is some unknown variable in the real world that we are trying to measure. In this case, it is \\(Y_{t}-Y_{c}\\), not \\(+4\\). An estimand is not the value you calculated, but is rather the unknown variable you want to estimate.\n\n\n\n\nDon Rubin was a Professor of Statistics at Harvard.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Causal and predictive models\nCausal inference is often compared with prediction. In prediction, we want to know an outcome, \\(Y\\). In causal inference, we want to know a function of potential outcomes, such as the treatment effect: \\(Y_t - Y_c\\).\nThese are both missing data problems. Prediction involves estimating an outcome variable that we don’t have, and thus is missing, whether because it is in the future or because it is from data that we are unable to collect. Thus, prediction is the term for using statistical inference to fill in missing data for individual outcomes. Causal inference, however, involves filling in missing data for more than one potential outcome. This is unlike prediction, where only one outcome can ever be observed, even in principle.\nKey point: In a predictive model, there is only one \\(Y\\) value for each unit. This is very different to the RCM where there are (at least) two potential outcomes (treatment and control). There is only one outcome column in a predictive model, whereas there are two or more in a causal model.\nWith a predictive model, we cannot infer what would happen to the outcome \\(Y\\) if we changed \\(X\\) for a given unit. We can only compare two units, one with one value of \\(X\\) and another with a different value of \\(X\\).\nIn a sense, all models are predictive. However, only a subset of models are causal, meaning that, for a given individual, you can change the value \\(X\\) and observe a change in outcome, \\(Y\\), and from that calculate a causal effect.\n\n1.2.4 No causation without manipulation\n\nIn order for a potential outcome to make sense, it must be possible, at least a priori, for a unit to receive both the treatment and the control. If a unit can not receive the treatment, for example, then \\(Y_t\\) is not defined and, therefore, the causal effect for that unit is not defined.\nThe causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers is the difference between two potential outcomes. In this case, we (or something else) can manipulate the world, at least conceptually, so that it is possible that one thing (exposure to Spanish speakers) or another (no exposure) might happen.\nThis definition of causal effects becomes much more problematic if there is no way for one of the potential outcomes to occur, ever. For example, what is the causal effect of Yao’s height on his weight? It might seem we would just need to compare two potential outcomes: Yao’s weight under the treatment (where treatment is defined as being 3 inches taller) and Yao’s weight under the control (where control is defined as his current height).\nA moment’s reflection highlights the problem: we can’t increase Yao’s height. There is no way to observe, even conceptually, what Yao’s weight would be if he were taller because there is no way to make him taller. We can’t manipulate Yao’s height, so it makes no sense to investigate the causal effect of height on weight. Hence the slogan: No causation without manipulation.\nThis then raises the question of what can and cannot be manipulated. If something cannot be manipulated, we should not consider it causal. Can race ever be considered causal? What about sex? A genetic condition like color blindness? Can we manipulate these characteristics? In the modern world these questions are not simple.\nConsider color blindness. Say we are interested in how color blindness impacts ability to complete a jig-saw puzzle. Because color blindness is genetic some might argue it cannot be manipulated. But advances in technology like gene therapy might allow us to actually change someone’s genes. Could we then claim the ability to manipulate color blindness? If yes, we could then measure the causal effect of color blindness on ability to complete jig-saw puzzles.\nThe slogan of “No causation without manipulation” may at first seem straight-forward, but it is not so simple. Questions about race, sex, and genetics are very complex and should be considered with care.\n\n1.2.5 Multiple units\n\nGenerally, a study has many individuals (or, more broadly, “units”) who each have their own potential outcomes. More notation is needed to allow us to differentiate between different units.\nIn other words, there needs to be a distinction between \\(Y_t\\) for Yao, and \\(Y_t\\) for Emma. We use the variable \\(u\\) (\\(u\\) for “unit”) to indicate that the outcome under control and the outcome under treatment can differ for each individual unit (person).\nInstead of \\(Y_t\\), we will use \\(Y_t(u)\\) to represent “Attitude if Treated.” If you want to talk about only Emma, you could say “Emma’s Attitude if Treated” or “\\(Y_t(u = Emma)\\)” or “the \\(Y_t(u)\\) for Emma”, but not just \\(Y_t\\). That notation is too ambiguous when there is more than one subject.\nLet’s look at a Preceptor Table with more subjects using our new notation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n9\n+4\n\n\nEmma\n14\n11\n+3\n\n\nCassidy\n11\n6\n+5\n\n\nTahmid\n9\n12\n-3\n\n\nDiego\n3\n4\n-1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this Preceptor Table, there are many possible estimands we might be interested in. Consider some examples, along with their true values:\n\n\n\nA potential outcome for one person, e.g., Yao’s potential outcome under treatment: \\(13\\).\nA causal effect for one person, such as for Emma. This is the difference between the potential outcomes: \\(14 - 11 = +3\\).\nThe most positive causal effect: \\(+5\\), for Cassidy.\nThe most negative causal effect: \\(-3\\), for Tahmid.\nThe median causal effect: \\(+3\\).\nThe median percentage change: \\(+27.2\\%\\). To see this, calculate the percentage change for each person. You’ll get 5 percentages: \\(+44.4\\%\\), \\(+27.2\\%\\), \\(+83.3\\%\\), \\(-25.0\\%\\), and \\(-25.0\\%\\).\n\n\nSimilar concepts can also be applied to the Population Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Table\n\n\nSource\nYear\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\n…\n2010\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nData\n2012\nYao\n5\n3\n+2\n\n\nData\n2012\nCassidy\n3\n6\n-3\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n…\n2018\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n2025\nYao\n13\n9\n+4\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n…\n2030\n?\n?\n?\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, all the rows in the Preceptor Table are, by definition, included in the Population Table. The later includes two sorts of extra rows. The first corresponds to our data set. The second corresponds to other unit/time combinations in the population which are neither part of the Preceptor Table nor part of the data.\nAll of the variables calculated in the Preceptor and Population Tables are examples of estimands we might be interested in. One estimand is important enough that it has its own name: the average treatment effect, often abbreviated as ATE. The average treatment effect is the mean of all the individual causal effects. Here, the mean is \\(+1.6\\).",

    "section": "\n1.3 Assumptions",
    "text": "1.3 Assumptions\nIn this section, we will explore the four key assumptions underlying any data science project: validity, stability, representativeness and unconfoundedness.\nRecall that the Population Table is constructed from three sources: the Preceptor Table, our data, and the greater population from which both are drawn. Consider a different Population Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Table\n\n\nSource\n\nOutcomes\n\nYear\n\nCovariates\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\nSex\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\n...\n?\n?\n2010\n?\n?\n\n\n...\n?\n?\n2010\n?\n?\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nData\n13\n?\n2012\nMale\n?\n\n\nData\n?\n9\n2012\nFemale\n?\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n?\n?\n2025\nFemale\n?\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n?\n?\n2025\nFemale\n?\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n...\n?\n?\n2025\n?\n?\n\n\n...\n?\n?\n2025\n?\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rows from our data have covariates and two potential outcomes. (By definition, we only know the value for one, at most, of the potential outcomes for each unit.) The rows from the Preceptor Table include covariates, but not outcomes. (We have no outcome data for 2025, but we will, in theory, be given the sex of any units about whom we need to make inferences.) The rows from our greater population include no data, as we know nothing about these units.\n\n\n\n1.3.1 Validity\n\nValidity is the consistency, or lack there of, in the columns of your data set and the corresponding columns in your Preceptor Table. In order to consider the two data sets to be drawn from the same population, the columns from one must have a valid correspondence with the columns in the other. Validity, if true (or at least reasonable), allows us to construct the Population Table.\nConsider the potential outcomes: attitude toward immigration under treatment and control. How is this measured? In this case, we use answers to survey questions. Are we going to use the exact same questions in 2025 as were used in our data from 2012? Probably not. Even if we used the same wording, will the meaning of the words be constant? Almost certainly not! The word “undocumented” could mean something very different in the America before the election of Donald Trump in 2016. Consider the treatment: exposure to Spanish speakers on a train platform. The speakers used in 2012 will not be available in 2025 if we were to redo the experiment.\nValidity is an assumption which allows us to “stack” the data and the Preceptor Table on top of one another, into a single Population Table. The variables from each source, while not identical in meaning, are similar enough that we can treat them as if they are the same thing.\n\n1.3.2 Stability\nStability means that the relationship between the columns in the Population Table is the same for three categories of rows: the data, the Preceptor Table, and the larger population from which both are drawn.\nWe will be constructing models, mathematical relationships between different variables. For example, perhaps the treatment has a greater effect on women than on men. However, we can only directly observe that relationship in the data which we have, from 2012. We must assume stability in order to use the model created from the data to make inferences about other rows in the Population Table, specifically the rows corresponding to the Preceptor Table.\nMust the world be stable? No! In fact, the world is always changing! The stability assumption, in this case, is a claim that the world has not changed that much between 2012 and 2025. Stability applies, not just to the data and the Preceptor Table rows, but to the entire Population Table. Stability allows us to ignore the passage of time.\n\n1.3.3 Representativeness\n\n\nRepresentativeness, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationships among the rows in the Population Table. The first is between the Preceptor Table and the other rows. The second is between our data and the other rows. Ideally, we would like both the Preceptor Table and our data to be random samples from the population. Sadly, this is almost never the case.\nDoes the train experiment allow us to calculate a causal effect for people who commute by cars? Can we calculate the causal effect for people in New York City? Before we generalize to a broader population we have to consider if our experimental estimates are applicable beyond our experiment. Maybe we think that commuters in Boston and New York are similar enough to generalize our findings. We could also conclude that people who commute by car are fundamentally different than people who commute by train. If that was true, then we could not say our estimate is true for all commuters because our sample does not accurately represent the broader group to which we want to generalize.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.3.4 Unconfoundedness\nA fourth assumption we use when working with causal models — but not with predictive models — is “unconfoundedness.” If whether or not a unit received treatment or control is random, we write that treatment assignment is not “confounded.” If, however, treatment assignment depends on the value of a potential outcome, then treatment assignment is confounded. Our lives are easiest if we can (reasonably!) assume unconfoundedness. In that case, we can estimate the average treatment effect by subtracting the average outcome for control units from the average outcome for treated units.\nConsider the “Perfect Doctor” as an example of the problems caused by confounded treatment assignments. Imagine we have an omniscient doctor who knows how any patient will respond to a certain drug. She has perfect knowledge of the entire Preceptor Table. Using this information, she always assign each patient the treatment with the best outcome, whether that is treatment or control. In this case, lower blood pressue is better. Consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHoly Grail of Information\n\n\nID\n\nBlood Pressure Outcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\nYao\n130\n105\n+25\n\n\nEmma\n120\n140\n-20\n\n\nCassidy\n100\n170\n-70\n\n\nTahmid\n115\n125\n-10\n\n\nDiego\n135\n100\n35\n\n\nMEAN\n120\n128\n-8\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Perfect Doctor would assign the treatment to Emma, Cassidy and Tahmid. She would assign control to Yao and Diego. And that is good! This is what the doctor should do. This is the best treatment assignment for the patients. But it is not a good assignment mechanism for estimating the average causal effect because treatment assignment is confounded by the values of the potential outcomes.\nWe, the non-Perfect Doctors, do not have access to the entire Preceptor Table. We can only see this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkewed Holy Grail of Information\n\n\nID\n\nBlood Pressure Outcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\nYao\n?\n105\n?\n\n\nEmma\n120\n?\n?\n\n\nCassidy\n100\n?\n?\n\n\nTahmid\n115\n?\n?\n\n\nDiego\n?\n100\n?\n\n\nMEAN\n111.66\n102.5\n9.16\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe true causal effect of the treatment, as we can see in the first table, is -8. In other words, the treatment lowers blood pressure on average. But, using just the data we have access to if the Perfect Doctor performs the treatment assignment, we would estimate — if we mistakenly assume unconfoundedness — that the causal effect is positive, that treatment increases blood pressure.\nThe best way to ensure unconfoundedness is to randomize the treatment across units. Don’t let the doctor decide who gets the treatment and who gets the control. Randomize assignment. As long as you use randomization as your assignment mechanism, you are good. There is the possibility that you can’t use pure randomization due to ethical or practical reasons, so we are forced to use a non-random assignment mechanisms. Many statistical methods have been developed for causal inference when there is a non-random assignment mechanism. Those methods, however, are largely beyond the scope of this book.",

    "section": "\n1.4 Simple models",
    "text": "1.4 Simple models\nHow can we fill in the question marks? Because of the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference, we can never know the missing values. Because we can never know the missing values, we must make assumptions. “Assumption” just means that we need a “model,” and all models have parameters.\n\n1.4.1 A single value for tau\nOne model might be that the causal effect is the same for everyone. There is a single parameter, \\(\\tau\\), which we then estimate. (\\(\\tau\\) is a Greek letter, written as “tau” and rhyming with “cow.”) Once we have an estimate, we can fill in the Preceptor Table because, knowing it, we can estimate what the unobserved potential outcome is for each person. We use our assumption about \\(\\tau\\) to estimate the counterfactual outcome for each unit.\nRemember what our Preceptor Table looks like with all of the missing data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n?\n?\n\n\nEmma\n14\n?\n?\n\n\nCassidy\n?\n6\n?\n\n\nTahmid\n?\n12\n?\n\n\nDiego\n3\n?\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we assume \\(\\tau\\) is the treatment effect for everyone, how do we fill in the table? We are using \\(\\tau\\) as an estimate for the causal effect. By definition: \\(Y_t(u) - Y_c(u) = \\tau\\). Using simple algebra, it is then clear that \\(Y_t(u) = Y_c(u) + \\tau\\) and \\(Y_c(u) = Y_t(u) - \\tau\\). In other words, you could add it to the observed outcome for every observation in the control group (or subtract it from the observed outcome for every observation in the treatment group), and thus fill in all the missing values.\nAssuming there is a constant treatment effect, \\(\\tau\\), for everyone, filling in the missing values would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n\\[13 - \\tau\\]\n\\[\\tau\\]\n\n\nEmma\n14\n\\[14 - \\tau\\]\n\\[\\tau\\]\n\n\nCassidy\n\\[6 + \\tau\\]\n6\n\\[\\tau\\]\n\n\nTahmid\n\\[12 + \\tau\\]\n12\n\\[\\tau\\]\n\n\nDiego\n3\n\\[3 - \\tau\\]\n\\[\\tau\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to find an estimate for \\(\\tau\\) in order to fill in the missing values. One approach is to subtract the average of the observed outcomes from units assigned to control from the average of the observed outcomes from units assigned to treatment: \\[((13 + 14 + 3) / 3) - ((6 + 12) /  2)\\] \\[10 - 9 = +1\\]\nOr, in other words, we use this formula:\n\\[\\frac{\\Sigma Y_t(u)}{n_t} + \\frac{\\Sigma Y_c(u)}{n_c} = \\widehat{ATE}\\]\n\\(\\Sigma\\) represents the sum of the outcomes under treatment or control, with \\(n_t\\) and \\(n_c\\) being the number of units assigned to treatment and control, respectively. This is the formula for \\(\\widehat{ATE}\\), our estimate of the average causal (or treatment) effect.\nContinuing with the example, calculating the ATE or the causal effect, gives us an estimate of \\(+1\\) for \\(\\tau\\). Let’s fill in our missing values by adding \\(\\tau\\) to the observed values under control and by subtracting \\(\\tau\\) from the observed value under treatment like so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n\\[13 - (+1)\\]\n+1\n\n\nEmma\n14\n\\[14 - (+1)\\]\n+1\n\n\nCassidy\n\\[6 + (+1)\\]\n6\n+1\n\n\nTahmid\n\\[12 + (+1)\\]\n12\n+1\n\n\nDiego\n3\n\\[3 - (+1)\\]\n+1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich gives us:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n12\n+1\n\n\nEmma\n14\n13\n+1\n\n\nCassidy\n7\n6\n+1\n\n\nTahmid\n13\n12\n+1\n\n\nDiego\n3\n2\n+1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we make the assumption that there is a single value for \\(\\tau\\) and that \\(1\\) is a good estimate of that value, then we can determine the missing potential outcomes. The Preceptor Table no longer has any missing values, so we can use it to easily answer (almost) any conceivable question.\n\n1.4.2 Two values for tau\nA second model might assume that the causal effect is different between levels of a category but the same within those levels. For example, perhaps there is a \\(\\tau_F\\) for females and \\(\\tau_M\\) for males where \\(\\tau_F might not equal \\tau_M\\). We are making this assumption to give us a different model with which we can fill in the missing values in our Preceptor Table. We can’t make any progress unless we make some assumptions. That is an inescapable consequence of the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference.\nA covariate is any variable outside of the (potential) outcomes. In this case, possible covariates include, but are not limited to, sex, age, political party and almost everything else which might be associated with attitudes toward immigration. Consider a model in which causal effects differ based on sex.

When we estimate \\(Y_c(Emma)\\) using an assumption of constant treatment effect (a single value for \\(\\tau\\)), we get \\(Y_c(Emma) = 13\\). When we estimate assuming treatment effect is constant for each sex, we calculate that \\(Y_c(Emma) = 8\\). This difference between our estimates for Emma highlights the difficulties of inference. Models drive inference. Different models will produce different inferences.\n\n1.4.3 Heterogenous treatment effects\nIs the assumption of a constant treatment effect, \\(\\tau\\), usually true? No! It is never true. People vary. The effect of a pill on you will always be different from the effect of a pill on your friend, at least if we measure outcomes accurately enough. Treatment effects are always heterogeneous, meaning that they vary across individuals.\nReality looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n\\[13 - \\tau_{yao}\\]\n\\[\\tau_{yao}\\]\n\n\nEmma\n14\n\\[14 - \\tau_{emma}\\]\n\\[\\tau_{emma}\\]\n\n\nCassidy\n\\[6 + \\tau_{cassidy}\\]\n6\n\\[\\tau_{cassidy}\\]\n\n\nTahmid\n\\[12 + \\tau_{tahmid}\\]\n12\n\\[\\tau_{tahmid}\\]\n\n\nDiego\n3\n\\[3 - \\tau_{diego}\\]\n\\[\\tau_{diego}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCan we solve for \\(\\tau_{yao}\\)? No! That is the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference. Instead, we usually focus on the average causal effect for the entire population.\n\n\n1.4.4 Average treatment effect\nThe average treatment effect (ATE), as discussed above, is the average difference in potential outcomes between the treated group and the control groups. Because averaging is a linear operator, the average difference is the same as the difference between the averages. The distinction between this estimand and estimands like \\(\\tau\\), \\(\\tau_M\\) and \\(\\tau_F\\), is that, in this case, we do not care about using the average treatment effect to fill in missing values in each row. The average treatment effect is useful because we don’t have to assume anything about each individuals’ \\(\\tau\\), like \\(\\tau_{yao}\\), but can still understand something about the average causal effect across the whole population.\nAs we did before, the simplest way to estimate the ATE is to take the mean of the treated group (\\(10\\)) and the mean of the control group (\\(9\\)) and then take the difference in those means (\\(1\\)). If we use this method to an estimate of the ATE, we’ll call it \\(\\widehat{ATE}\\), pronounced “ATE-hat.”\nAs we noted before, this is a popular estimand. Why?\n\nThere’s an obvious estimator for this estimand: the mean difference of the observed outcomes between the treated group and the control group: \\(\\overline{Y_t(u)} - \\overline{Y_c(u)}\\).\nIf treatment is randomly assigned, the estimator is unbiased: you can be fairly confident in the estimate if you have a large enough treatment and control groups.\nIf you are willing to assume that the causal effect is the same for everyone (a big assumption!), you can use your estimate of the ATE, \\(\\widehat{ATE}\\), to fill in the missing individual values in your Preceptor Table.\n\nJust because the ATE is often a useful estimand doesn’t mean that it always is.\nConsider point #3. For example, let’s say the treatment effect does vary dependent on sex. For males there is a small negative effect (-4), but for females there is a larger positive effect (+8). However, the average treatment effect for the whole sample, even if you estimate it correctly, will be a single positive number (+1) – since the positive effect for females is larger than the negative effect for males.\n\nEstimating the average treatment effect, by calculating \\(\\widehat{ATE}\\), is easy. But is our \\(\\widehat{ATE}\\) a good estimate of the actual ATE? After all, if we knew all the missing values in the Preceptor Table, we could calculate the ATE perfectly. But those missing values may be wildly different from the observed values. Consider this Preceptor Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcomes\n\n\nCausal Effect\n\n\n\n\\[Y_t(u)\\]\n\\[Y_c(u)\\]\n\\[Y_t(u) - Y_c(u)\\]\n\n\n\n\nYao\n13\n10\n+3\n\n\nEmma\n14\n11\n+3\n\n\nCassidy\n9\n6\n+3\n\n\nTahmid\n15\n12\n+3\n\n\nDiego\n3\n0\n+3\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, there is indeed a constant treatment effect for everyone: \\(+3\\). Note that the observed values are all the same, but the unobserved values were such that our estimated ATE, \\(+1\\), is pretty far from the actual ATE, \\(+3\\). If we think we have a reasonable estimate of ATE, using that value as a constant for \\(\\tau\\) might be our best guess.",

Unfortunately, there is always data missing.\nA Population Table has three sources of data: the Preceptor Table, the data set, and the greater population from which both are drawn.\nA Potential Outcome is the outcome for an individual depending on if they receive the treatment or not.\nA Causal Effect is the difference between two potential outcomes. The term treatment effect is used interchangeably with causal effect.\nATE, the average treatment (or causal) effect, is the average of the causal (treatment) effect for the units of interest. We often drop the word “average” since it is implied. By convention, causal effect, treatment effect and average treatment effect all refer to the same (unknown) number.\nThe Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is that it is impossible to observe the causal effect on a single unit because we can never observe both potential outcomes for that unit. We must make assumptions in order to estimate causal effects.\nWhen confronting a causal question, first identify the units, treatments and outcomes.\n\n\n\nThe fundamental components of every problem in causal inference are units, treatments and outcomes. The units are the rows in the table. The treatments are (some of) the columns. The outcomes are the values under the treatment columns. (There are also covariate columns and the values within them.) Whenever you confront a problem in causal inference, start by identifying the units, treatments and outcomes.\nA causal effect is the difference between one potential outcome and another. How different would your life be if you missed the train?\n\n\nA Preceptor Table includes all rows and columns such that, if no data is missing, it is easy to calculate our quantity of interest. Unfortunately, data is always missing in causal models because, at most, we can only observe one potential outcome for each unit. The causal effect of a treatment on a single unit at a point in time is the difference between the value of the outcome variable with the treatment and without the treatment. The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference is that it is impossible to observe the causal effect on a single unit. We must make assumptions — i.e, we must make models — in order to estimate causal effects.\nThe Population Table has three sources of data: the Preceptor Table, the data set, and the greater population from which both are drawn.\nThe assumption of validity, if met, allows us to create the Population Table because it ensures that the columns of data from the different sources can be put into a single table. If the relationships among the data are the same (or at least same’ish), over time, then we can assume stability. A model estimated on our data will also apply to our Preceptor Table. Representativeness examines the rows we have relative to the rows in the Population Table which we might have had. Unconfoundedness, which only matters in causal settings, means that either the treatment was randomly assigned or that we can act as if it was.\nRandom assignment of treatments to units is the best experimental set up for estimating causal effects. Other assignment mechanisms are subject to confounding. If the treatment assigned is correlated with the potential outcomes, it is very hard to estimate the true treatment effect. (As always, we use the terms “causal effects” and “treatment effects” interchangeably.) With random assignment, we can, mostly safely, estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) by looking at the difference between the average outcomes of the treated and control units.\nBe wary of claims made in situations without random assignment: Here be dragons!\n\n\n\n\nEnos, Ryan D. 2014. “Causal Effect of Intergroup Contact on Exclusionary Attitudes.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 111 (10): 3699–3704. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1317670111.",

    "text": "2.1 Distributions\nThe central tension, and opportunity, in data science is the interplay between the data and the science, between our empirical observations and the models which we create to use them. Probability is the language we use to explore that interplay; it connects data to models, and models to inference.\nWhat does it mean that Donald Trump had a 30% chance of winning election in the fall of 2016? That there is a 90% probability of rain tomorrow? That the dice at the casino are fair?\nProbability quantifies uncertainty. Think of probability as a proportion. The probability of an event occurring is a number from 0 to 1, where 0 means that the event is impossible and 1 means that the event is 100% certain.\nBegin with the simplest events: coin flips and dice rolls. The set of all outcomes is the sample space. With fair coins and dice, we know that:\nIf the probability of an outcome is unknown, we will often refer to it as an unknown parameter, something which we might use data to estimate. We usually use Greek letters to refer to parameters. Whenever we are talking about a specific probability (represented by a single value), we will use \\(\\rho\\) (the Greek letter “rho” but spoken aloud as “p” by us) with a subscript which specifies the exact outcome of which it is the probability. For instance, \\(\\rho_h = 0.5\\) denotes the probability of getting heads on a coin toss when the coin is fair. \\(\\rho_t\\) — spoken as “PT” or “P sub T” or “P tails” — denotes the probability of getting tails on a coin toss. This notation can become annoying if the outcome whose probability we seek is less concise. For example, we might write the probability of rolling a 1, 2 or 3 using a fair six-sided dice as:\n\\[\n\\rho_{dice\\ roll\\ is\\ 1,\\ 2\\ or\\ 3} = 0.5\n\\]\nWe will rarely write out the full definition of an event along with the \\(\\rho\\) symbol. The syntax is just too ugly. Instead, we will define an event a as the case when one rolled dice equals 1, 2 or 3 and, then, write\n\\[\\rho_a = 0.5\\]\nA random variable is a function which produces a value from a sample set. A random variable can be either discrete — where the sample set has a limited number of members, like H or T for the result of a coin flip, or 2, 3, …, 12 for the sum of two dice — or continuous (any value within a range). Probability is a claim about the value of a random variable, i.e., that you have a 50% probability of getting a 1, 2 or 3 when you roll a fair dice.\nWe usually use capital letters for random variables. So, \\(C\\) might be our symbol for the random variable which is a coin toss and \\(D\\) might be our symbol for the random variable which is the sum of two dice. When discussing random variables in general, or when we grow tired of coming up with new symbols, we will use \\(Y\\).\nSmall letters refer to a single outcome or result from a random variable. \\(c\\) is the outcome from one coin toss. \\(d\\) is the result from one throw of the two dice. The value of the outcome must come from the sample space. So, \\(c\\) can only take on two possible values: heads or tails. When discussing random variables in general, we use \\(y\\) to refer to one outcome of the random variable \\(Y\\). If there are multiple outcomes — if we have, for example, flipped the coin multiple times — then we use subscripts to indicate the separate outcomes: \\(y_1\\), \\(y_2\\), and so on. The symbol for an arbitrary outcome is \\(y_i\\), where \\(i\\) ranges from 1 through \\(N\\), the total number of events or experiments for which an outcome \\(y\\) was produced.\nThe only package we need in this chapter is tidyverse.\nTo understand probability more fully, we first need to understand distributions.\nA variable in a tibble is a column, a vector of values. We sometimes refer to this vector as a “distribution.” This is somewhat sloppy in that a distribution can be many things, most commonly a mathematical formula. But, strictly speaking, a “frequency distribution” or an “empirical distribution” is a list of values, so this usage is not unreasonable.",

In some sense, both vectors are from the same distribution. Relative proportions, not the total counts, are what matter.\n\n2.1.2 Normalizing distributions\nIf two distributions have the same shape, then they only differ by the labels on the y-axis. There are various ways of “normalizing” distributions so as to place them all on the same scale. The most common scale is one in which the area under the distribution adds to 1, e.g., 100%. For example, we can transform the above plots:\n\nShow the coderolls_p &lt;- tibble(value = ten_rolls) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = value)) +\n    geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count)))) +\n    labs(title = \"Distribution of 10 Rolls\",\n         y = \"Percentage\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))\n\nmore_rolls_p &lt;- tibble(value = more_rolls) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(value)) +\n    geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count)))) +\n    labs(title = \"Distribution of 1,000 Rolls\",\n         y = NULL) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))\n\nrolls_p + more_rolls_p\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sometimes refer to a distribution as “unnormalized” if the area under the curve does not add up to 1.\n\n2.1.3 Simulating distributions\nThere are two distinct concepts: a distribution and a set values drawn from that distribution. But, in typical usage, we employ “distribution” for both. When given a distribution (meaning a vector of numbers), we often use geom_histogram() or geom_density() to display it. But, sometimes, we don’t want to look at the whole thing. We just want some summary measures which report the key aspects of the distribution. The two most important attributes of a distribution are its center and its variation around that center.\n\nWe use summarize() to calculate statistics for a variable, a column, a vector of values, or a distribution. Note the language sloppiness. For the purposes of this book, “variable,” “column,” “vector,” and “distribution” all mean the same thing. Other popular statistical functions include: mean(), median(), min(), max(), n() and sum(). Functions which may be new to you include three measures of the “spread” of a distribution: sd() (the standard deviation), mad() (the scaled median absolute deviation) and quantile(), which is used to calculate an interval which includes a specified proportion of the values.\n\nThink of the distribution of a variable as an urn from which we can pull out, at random, values for that variable. Drawing a thousand or so values from that urn, and then looking at a histogram, can show where the values are centered and how they vary. Because people are sloppy, they will use the word distribution to refer to at least three related entities:\n\nthe (imaginary!) urn from which we are drawing values.\nall the values in the urn\nall the values which we have drawn from the urn, whether that be 10 or 1,000\n\nSloppiness in the usage of the word distribution is universal. However, keep three distinct ideas separate:\n\nThe unknown true distribution which, in reality, generates the data which we see. Outside of stylized examples in which we assume that a distribution follows a simple mathematical formula, we will never have access to the unknown true distribution. We can only estimate it. This unknown true distribution is often referred to as the data generating mechanism, or DGM. It is a function or black box or urn which produces data. We can see the data. We can’t see the urn.\nThe estimated distribution which, we think, generates the data which we see. Again, we can never know the unknown true distribution. But, by making some assumptions and using the data we have, we can estimate a distribution. Our estimate may be very close to the true distribution. Or it may be far away. The main task of data science to to create and use these estimated distributions. Almost always, these distributions are instantiated in computer code. Just as there is a true data generating mechanism associated with the (unknown) true distribution, there is an estimated data generating mechanism associated with the estimated ditribution.\nA vector of numbers drawn from the estimated distribution. Both true and estimated distributions can be complex animals, difficult to describe accurately and in detail. But a vector of numbers drawn from a distribution is easy to understand and use. So, in general, we work with vectors of numbers. When someone — either a colleague or a piece of R code — creates a distribution which we want to use to answer a question, we don’t really want the distribution itself. Rather, we want a vector of “draws” from that distribution. Vectors are easy to work with! Complex computer code is not.\n\nAgain, people (including us!) will often be sloppy and use the same word, “distribution,” without making it clear whether they are talking about the true distribution, the estimated distribution, or a vector of draws from the estimated distribution. The same sloppiness applies to the use of the term data generating mechanism. Try not to be sloppy.",

    "text": "2.2 Probability distributions\n\nShow the codeknitr::include_graphics(\"probability/images/de_finetti.jpg\")\n\n\n\nBruno de Finetti, an Italian statistician who wrote a famous treatise on the theory of probability that began with the statement “PROBABILITY DOES NOT EXIST.”\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this Primer, a probability distribution is a mathematical object which maps a set of outcomes to probabilities, where each distinct outcome has a chance of occurring between 0 and 1 inclusive. The probabilities must sum to 1. The set of possible outcomes, i.e., the sample space — heads and tails for the coin, 1 through 6 for a single dice, 2 through 12 for the sum of a pair of dice — can be either discrete or continuous. Discrete data can only take on certain values. Continuous data, like height and weight, can take any value within a range. The set of outcomes is the domain of the probability distribution. The range is the associated probabilities.\nAssume that a probability distribution is created by a probability function, a set function which maps outcomes to probabilities. The concept of a “probability function” is often split into two categories: probability mass functions (for discrete random variables) and probability density functions (for continuous random variables). As usual, we will be a bit sloppy, using the term probability distribution for both the mapping itself and for the function which creates the mapping.\nWe discuss three types of probability distributions: empirical, mathematical, and posterior.\nThe key difference between a distribution, as we have explored them in Section 2.1, and a probability distribution is the requirement that the sum of the probabilities of the individual outcomes must be exactly 1. There is no such requirement for a distribution in general. But any distribution can be turned into a probability distribution by “normalizing” it. In this context, we will often refer to a distribution which is not (yet) a probability distribution as an “unnormalized” distribution.\n\nPay attention to notation. Recall that when we are talking about a specific probability (represented by a single value), we will use \\(\\rho\\) (the Greek letter “rho”) with a subscript which specifies the exact outcome of which it is the probability. For instance, \\(\\rho_h = 0.5\\) denotes the probability of getting heads on a coin toss when the coin is fair. \\(\\rho_t\\) — spoken as “PT” or “P sub T” or “P tails” — denotes the probability of getting tails on a coin toss. However, when we are referring to the entire probability distribution over a set of outcomes, we will use \\(P()\\). For example, the probability distribution of a coin toss is \\(P(\\text{coin})\\). That is, \\(P(\\text{coin})\\) is composed of the two specific probabilities (e.g., 60% and 40% for a biased coin) mapped from the two values in the domain (heads and tails). Similarly, \\(P(\\text{sum of two dice})\\) is the probability distribution over the set of 11 outcomes (2 through 12) which are possible when you take the sum of two dice. \\(P(\\text{sum of two dice})\\) is made up of 11 numbers — \\(\\rho_2\\), \\(\\rho_3\\), …, \\(\\rho_{12}\\) — each representing the unknown probability that the sum will equal their value. That is, \\(\\rho_2\\) is the probability of rolling a 2.\nA distribution is a function that shows the possible values of a variable and how often they occur.\n\n2.2.1 Flipping a coin\nData science problems start with a question. Example:\nWhat are the chances of getting three heads in a row when flipping a fair coin?\nQuestions are answered with the help of probability distributions.\nAn empirical distribution is based on data. Think of this as the probability distribution created by collecting data in the real world or by running a simulation on your computer. In theory, if we increase the number of coins we flip (either in reality or via simulation), the empirical distribution will look more and more similar to the mathematical distribution. The mathematical distribution is the Platonic form. The empirical distribution will often look like the mathematical probability distribution, but it will rarely be exactly the same.\nIn this simulation, there are 44 heads and 56 tails. The outcome will vary every time we run the simulation, but the proportion of heads to tails should not be too different if the coin is fair.\n\nShow the code# We are flipping one fair coin a hundreds times. We need to get the same result\n# each time we create this graphic because we want the results to match the\n# description in the text. Using set.seed() guarantees that the random results\n# are the same each time. We define 0 as tails and 1 as heads.\n\nset.seed(3)\n\ntibble(results = sample(c(0, 1), 100, replace = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = results)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                   binwidth = 0.5, \n                   color = \"white\") +\n    labs(title = \"Empirical Probability Distribution\",\n         subtitle = \"Flipping one coin a hundred times\",\n         x = \"Outcome\\nResult of Coin Flip\",\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1), \n                       labels = c(\"Heads\", \"Tails\")) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = \n                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA mathematical distribution is based on a mathematical formula. Assuming that the coin is perfectly fair, we should, on average, get heads as often as we get tails.\n\nShow the code# The mathematical case with the expected 50/50 outcome hard-coded.\n\ntibble(results = c(rep(0, 50),\n                   rep(1, 50))) |&gt; \nggplot(aes(x = results)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                 binwidth = 0.5, \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"Mathematical Probability Distribution\",\n       subtitle = \"Expectations for flipping a fair coin\",\n       x = \"Outcome\\nResult of Coin Flip\",\n       y = \"Probability\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1), \n                     labels = c(\"Heads\", \"Tails\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels =\n                      scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution of a single observation is described by this formula.\n\\[ P(Y = y) = \\begin{cases} 1/2 &\\text{for }y= \\text{Heads}\\\\ 1/2 &\\text{for }y= \\text{Tails} \\end{cases}\\] We sometimes do not know that the probability of heads and the probability of tails both equal 50%. In that case, we might write:\n\\[ P(Y = y) = \\begin{cases} \\rho_H &\\text{for }y= \\text{Heads}\\\\ \\rho_T &\\text{for }y= \\text{Tails} \\end{cases}\\]\nYet, we know that, by definition, \\(\\rho_H + \\rho_T = 1\\), so we can rewrite the above as:\n\\[ P(Y = y) = \\begin{cases} \\rho_H &\\text{for }y= \\text{Heads}\\\\ 1- \\rho_H &\\text{for }y= \\text{Tails} \\end{cases}\\]\nCoin flipping (and related scenarios with only two possible outcomes) are such common problems that the notation is often simplified further, with \\(\\rho\\) understood, by convention, to be the probability of heads (or TRUE). In that case, we can write the mathematical distribution is two canonical forms:\n\\[P(Y) = Bernoulli(\\rho)\\] and\n\\[y_i \\sim Bernoulli(\\rho)\\] All five of these versions mean the same thing! The first four describe the mathematical probability distribution for a fair coin. The capital \\(Y\\) within the \\(P()\\) indicates a random variable. The fifth highlights one “draw” from that random variable, hence the lower case \\(y\\) and the subscript \\(i\\).\nMost probability distributions do not have special names, which is why we will use the generic symbol \\(P\\) to refer to them. But some common probability distributions do have names, like “Bernoulli” in this case.\nIf the mathematical assumptions are correct, then, as your sample size increases, the empirical probability distribution will look more and more like the mathematical distribution.\nA posterior distribution is based on beliefs and expectations. It displays your beliefs about things you can’t see right now. You may have posterior distributions for outcomes in the past, present, or future.\nIn the case of the coin toss, the posterior distribution changes depending on your beliefs. For instance, let’s say your friend brought a coin to school and asked to bet you. If the result is heads, you have to pay them $5. In that case, your posterior probability distribution might look like this:\n\nShow the code# Hard-code the creation of the posterior.\n\ntibble(results = c(rep(0, 95),\n                   rep(1, 5))) |&gt; \nggplot(aes(x = results)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                 binwidth = 0.5, \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"Posterior Probability Distribution\",\n       subtitle = \"Your beliefs about flipping one coin to bet your friend\",\n       x = \"Outcome\\nResult of Coin Flip\",\n       y = \"Probability\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1), \n                     labels = c(\"Heads\", \"Tails\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = \n                       scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that your friend wants to bet on heads suggests to you that the coin is not fair. Does it prove that the coin is unfair? No! Much depends on the sort of person you think your friend is. Your posterior probability distribution is your opinion, based on your experiences and beliefs. My posterior probability distribution will often be (very) different from yours.\nThe full terminology is mathematical (or empirical or posterior) probability distribution. But we will often shorten this to just mathematical (or empirical or posterior) distribution. The word “probability” is understood, even if it is not present.\n\nRecall the question with which we started this section: What are the chances of getting three heads in a row when flipping a fair coin? To answer this question, we need to use a probability distribution as our data generating mechanism. Fortunately, the rbinom() function allows us to generate the results for coin flips. For example:\n\nShow the coderbinom(n = 10, size = 1, prob = 0.5)\n\n [1] 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\ngenerates the results of 10 coin flips, where a result of heads is presented as 1 and tails as 0. With this tool, we can generate 1,000 draws from our experiment:\n\nShow the codetibble(toss_1 = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5),\n       toss_2 = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5),\n       toss_3 = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5))\n\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 3\n   toss_1 toss_2 toss_3\n    &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;\n 1      0      1      1\n 2      0      1      1\n 3      0      1      0\n 4      0      0      1\n 5      1      1      0\n 6      1      0      1\n 7      1      0      0\n 8      1      0      1\n 9      0      0      1\n10      0      1      1\n# ℹ 990 more rows\n\n\nBecause the flips are independent, we can consider each row to be a draw from the experiment. Then, we simply count up the proportion of experiments in which resulted in three heads.\n\nShow the codetibble(toss_1 = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5),\n       toss_2 = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5),\n       toss_3 = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.5)) |&gt; \n  mutate(three_heads = toss_1 + toss_2 + toss_3 == 3) |&gt; \n  summarize(chance = mean(three_heads))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  chance\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  0.104\n\n\nThis is close to the “correct” answer of \\(1/8\\)th. If we increase the number of draws, we will get closer to the “truth.” The reason for the quotation marks around “correct” and “truth” is that we are uncertain. We don’t know the true probability distribution for this coin. If this coin is a trick coin — like the one we expect our friend to have brought to school — then the odds of three heads in a row would be much higher:\n\nShow the codetibble(toss_1 = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.95),\n       toss_2 = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.95),\n       toss_3 = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = 0.95)) |&gt; \n  mutate(three_heads = toss_1 + toss_2 + toss_3 == 3) |&gt; \n  summarize(chance = mean(three_heads))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  chance\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1   0.87\n\n\nThis is our first example of using a data generating mechanism — meaning rbinom() — to answer a question. We will see many more in the chapters to come.\n\n2.2.2 Rolling two dice\nData science begins with a question:\nWhat is the probability of rolling a 7 or an 11 with a pair of dice?\nWe get an empirical distribution by rolling two dice a hundred times, either by hand or with a computer simulation. The result is not identical to the mathematical distribution because of the inherent randomness of the real world and/or of simulation.\n\nShow the code# In the coin example, we create the vector ahead of time, and then assigned\n# that vector to a tibble. There was nothing wrong with that approach. And we\n# could do the same thing here. But the use of map_* functions is more powerful,\n# although it requires creating the 100 rows of the tibble at the start and then\n# doing things \"row-by_row.\"\n\nset.seed(1)\n\nemp_dist_dice &lt;- tibble(ID = 1:100) |&gt; \n  mutate(die_1 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) |&gt; \n  mutate(die_2 = map_dbl(ID, ~ sample(c(1:6), size = 1))) |&gt; \n  mutate(sum = die_1 + die_2) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = sum)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                   binwidth = 1, \n                   color = \"white\") +\n    labs(title = \"Empirical Probability Distribution\",\n         subtitle = \"Sum from rolling two dice, replicated one hundred times\",\n         x = \"Outcome\\nSum of Two Dice\",\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n    theme_classic()\n\nemp_dist_dice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe might consider labeling the y-axis in plots of empirical distributions as “Proportion” rather than “Probability” since it is an actual proportion, calculated from real (or simulated) data. We will keep it as “Probability” since we want to emphasize the parallels between mathematical, empirical and posterior probability distributions.\nOur mathematical distribution tells us that, with a fair dice, the probability of getting 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are equal: there is a 1/6 chance of each. When we roll two dice at the same time and sum the numbers, the values closest to the middle are more common than values at the edge because there are more combinations of numbers that add up to the middle values.\n\nShow the codetibble(sum = c(rep(c(2, 12), 1), \n               rep(c(3, 11), 2),\n               rep(c(4, 10), 3), \n               rep(c(5,  9), 4),\n               rep(c(6,  8), 5),\n               rep(c(7), 6))) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = sum)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                   binwidth = 1, \n                   color = \"white\") +\n    labs(title = \"Mathematical Probability Distribution\",\n         subtitle = \"Expectation for the sum from rolling two dice\",\n         x = \"Outcome\\nSum of Two Dice\",\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = \n                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[ P(Y = y) = \\begin{cases} \\dfrac{y-1}{36} &\\text{for }y=1,2,3,4,5,6 \\\\ \\dfrac{13-y}{36} &\\text{for }y=7,8,9,10,11,12 \\\\ 0 &\\text{otherwise} \\end{cases} \\]\nThe posterior distribution for rolling two dice depends on your beliefs. If you take the dice from your Monopoly set, you have reason to believe that the assumptions underlying the mathematical distribution are true. However, if you walk into a crooked casino and a host asks you to play craps, you might be suspicious, meaning that you suspect that the data generating mechanism for these dice is not like that for fair dice. For example, in craps, a “come-out” roll of 7 and 11 is a “natural,” resulting in a win for the “shooter” and, therefore, a loss for the casino. You might expect those numbers to occur less often than they would with fair dice. Meanwhile, a come-out roll of 2, 3 or 12 is a loss for the shooter. You might also expect values like 2, 3 and 12 to occur more frequently. Your posterior distribution might look like this:\n\nShow the code# Hard code our posterior about the crooked casino.\n\ntibble(results = c(rep(2, 15), rep(3, 15), rep(4, 7), \n                   rep(5, 7), rep(6, 7), rep(7, 4),\n                   rep(8, 7), rep(9, 7), rep(10, 7), \n                   rep(11, 3), rep(12, 15))) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = results)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                   binwidth = 1, \n                   color = \"white\") +\n    labs(title = \"Posterior Probability Distribution\",\n         subtitle = \"Your belief about the sum of two dice at a crooked casino\",\n         x = \"Outcome\\nSum of Two Dice\",\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 12, 1), labels = 2:12) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = \n                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone less suspicious of the casino would have a posterior distribution which looks more like the mathematical distribution.\nWe began this section with a question about the probability (or odds) of rolling a 7 or 11 — i.e., a “natural” — with a pair of dice. The answer to the question depends on whether or not we think the dice are fair. In other words, we need to know which distribution to use to answer the question.\nAssume that the dice are fair. In that case, we can create a data generating mechanism by hand. (Alas, there is not a built-in R function for dice like there is for coin flips with rbinom().)\n\nShow the codeset.seed(7)\n\n# Creating a variable like rolls makes our code easier to read and modify. Of\n# course, we could just hard code the 4 into the size argument for each of the\n# two calls to sample, but that is much less convenient.\n\nrolls &lt;- 4\n\n# The details of the code matter. If we don't have replace = TRUE, sample will\n# only use each of the 6 possible values once. That might be OK if we are just\n# rolling the dice 4 times, but it won't work for thousands of rolls.\n\ntibble(dice_1 = sample(x = 1:6, size = rolls, replace = TRUE),\n       dice_2 = sample(x = 1:6, size = rolls, replace = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(result = dice_1 + dice_2) |&gt; \n  mutate(natural = ifelse(result %in% c(7, 11), TRUE, FALSE))\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 4\n  dice_1 dice_2 result natural\n   &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;  \n1      2      2      4 FALSE  \n2      3      6      9 FALSE  \n3      4      3      7 TRUE   \n4      2      6      8 FALSE  \n\n\nThis code is another data generating mechanism or DGM. It allows us to simulate the distribution of the results from rolling a pair of fair dice. To answer our question, we simply increase the number of rolls and calculate the proportion of rolls which result in a 7 or 11.\n\nShow the coderolls &lt;- 100000\n\n# We probably don't need 100,000 rolls, but this code is so fast that it does\n# not matter. Generally 1,000 (or even 100) draws from the data generating\n# mechanism is enough for most practical purposes.\n\ntibble(dice_1 = sample(x = 1:6, size = rolls, replace = TRUE),\n       dice_2 = sample(x = 1:6, size = rolls, replace = TRUE)) |&gt; \n  mutate(result = dice_1 + dice_2) |&gt; \n  summarize(natural_perc = mean(result %in% c(7, 11)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n  natural_perc\n         &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        0.221\n\n\nThe probability of rolling either a 7 or an 11 with a pair of fair dice is about 22%.\n\n2.2.3 Presidential elections\nData science begins with a question:\nWhat is the probability that the Democratic candidate will win the Presidential election?\nConsider the probability distribution for a political event, like a presidential election. We want to know the probability that Democratic candidate wins X electoral votes, where X comes from the range of possible outcomes: 0 to 538. (The total number of electoral votes in US elections since 1964 is 538.)\n\nThe empirical distribution in this case would involve counting the number of electoral votes that the Democratic candidate won in each of the Presidential elections in the last 50 years or so. Looking at elections since 1964, we can observe that the number of electoral votes that the Democratic candidate received in each election is different.\n\nShow the code# Votes are since 1964, for Democratic candidate\n\nmydata &lt;- tibble(electoral_votes = c(486, 191,  17, 297, 49, 13, 111, \n                                     370, 379, 266, 251, 365, 332, \n                                     227, 306, 226))\n\n# 226 is electoral votes for Joe Biden in 2024 presidential election.\n\nggplot(mydata, aes(x = electoral_votes)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                 bins = 100, \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"Empirical Probability Distribution\",\n       subtitle = \"Electoral votes from 16 previous elections\",\n       x = \"Outcome\\nElectoral Vote Total for Democratic Candidate\",\n       y = \"Probability\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 500, 100)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = \n                       scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven that we only have 15 observations, it is difficult to draw conclusions or make predictions based off of this empirical distribution. But “difficult” does not mean “impossible.” For example, if someone, more than a year before the election, offered to bet us 50/50 that the Democratic candidate was going to win more than 475 electoral votes, we would take the bet. After all, this outcome has only happened once in the last 15 elections, so a 50/50 bet seems like a great deal.\nWe can build a mathematical distribution for X which assumes that the chances of the Democratic candidate winning any given state’s electoral votes is 0.5 and that the results from each state are independent.\n\nShow the code# Code currently produces a warning about missing values. Not sure why? Maybe an\n# interaction with the hard-coded limits in the x-axis? \n\n# We want the hard-coded limits because we want to make it obvious that the\n# mathematical results suggest that outcomes &lt; 100 or &gt; 400 are essentially\n# impossible. Text could make that more clear.\n\n# rep(3,8) means there are 8 states that have 3 electoral votes, via the same\n# for the rest of the code chunck. We use c() to make the rep() functions\n# together, so that we can use it in tibble().\n\n# I think these electoral votes are for 2016. Probably should update them for post 2020 census.\n\nev &lt;- c(rep(3, 8), rep(4, 5), rep(5, 3), rep(6, 6), rep(7, 3), rep(8,2),\n        rep(9, 3), rep(10, 4), rep(11, 4), 12, 13, 14, 15, rep(16, 2), 18, 20 , 20, 19, 29, 38, 55)\n\nsims &lt;- 10000\n\nresult &lt;- tibble(total = (matrix(rbinom(sims*length(ev),\n                        size = 1, p = 0.5),\n                 ncol = length(ev)) %*% ev)[,1])\n\nggplot(data = result, aes(total)) +\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                 binwidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Mathematical Probability Distribution\",\n       subtitle = \"Presidential elections with each state being 50/50 and independent\",\n       y = \"Probability\",\n       x = \"Outcome\\nElectoral Vote Total for Democratic Candidate\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 500, 100), limits = c(0, 540)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = \n                       scales::percent_format()) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf our assumptions about this mathematical distribution are correct — they are not! — then, as the sample size increase, the empirical distribution should look more and more similar to our mathematical distribution.\nHowever, the data from past elections is more than enough to demonstrate that the assumptions of our mathematical probability distribution do not work for electoral votes. The model assumes that the Democrats have a 50% chance of receiving each of the total electoral votes from the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Just looking at the mathematical probability distribution, we can observe that receiving 13 or 17 or 486 votes out of 538 would be extreme and almost impossible if the mathematical model were accurate. However, our empirical distribution shows that such extreme outcomes are quite common. Presidential elections have resulted in much bigger victories or defeats than this mathematical distribution seems to allow for, thereby demonstrating that our assumptions are false.\nThe posterior distribution of electoral votes is a popular topic, and an area of strong disagreement, among data scientists. Consider this posterior from FiveThirtyEight.\n\nShow the code# This data was downloaded by hand from the 538 website.\n\n# Have to include these cols type, otherwise it will shows up this \"Column\n# specification\", thing on the primer, not pretty.\n\nread_csv(\"./probability/data/election-forecasts-2020/prez_1.csv\",\n         col_types = cols(cycle = col_double(),\n                          branch = col_character(),\n                          model = col_character(),\n                          modeldate = col_character(),\n                          candidate_inc = col_character(),\n                          candidate_chal = col_character(),\n                          candidate_3rd = col_logical(),\n                          evprob_inc = col_double(),\n                          evprob_chal = col_double(),\n                          evprob_3rd = col_logical(),\n                          total_ev = col_double(),\n                          timestamp = col_character(),\n                          simulations = col_double())) |&gt;\n  select(evprob_chal, total_ev)  |&gt; \n  rename(prob = evprob_chal, electoral_votes = total_ev) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(electoral_votes, prob)) +\n    geom_bar(stat = 'identity') +\n    labs(title = \"Posterior Probability Distribution\",\n         subtitle = \"Democratic electoral votes according to 538 forecast\",\n         y = \"Probability\",\n         x = \"Outcome\\nElectoral Vote Total for Democratic Candidate\",\n         caption = \"Data from August 13, 2020\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 0.01, 0.02),\n                     labels = \n                       scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a posterior probability distribution from the FiveThirtyEight website for August 13, 2020. This was created using the same data as the above distribution, but is displayed differently. For each electoral result, the height of the bar represents the probability that a given event will occur. However, there are no labels on the y-axis telling us what the specific probability of each outcome is. And that is OK! The specific values are not that useful. If we removed the labels on our own y-axes, would it matter? Probably not. Anytime there are many possible outcomes — over 500 in this case — we stop looking at specific outcomes and, instead, look at where most of the “mass” of the distribution lies.\n\nShow the codeknitr::include_graphics(\"probability/images/fivethirtyeight.png\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the posterior probability distribution from The Economist, also from August 13, 2020.

Real life is not a problem set.\n\nShow the codeknitr::include_graphics(\"probability/images/538_versus_Economist.png\")\n\n\n\nWatch the makers of these two models throw shade at each other on Twitter! Eliot Morris is one of the primary authors of the Economist model. Nate Silver is in charge of 538. They don’t seem to be too impressed with each other’s work! More smack talk here and here.\n\n\n\nThere are many questions you could explore with posterior distributions. They can relate to the past, present, or future.\n\nPast: How many electoral votes would Hilary Clinton have won if she had picked a different VP?\nPresent: What are the total campaign donations from New College faculty?\nFuture: How many electoral votes will the Democratic candidate for president win in 2036?\n\n\n2.2.4 Height\n\nQuestion: What is the height of the next adult male we will meet?\nThe three examples above are all discrete probability distributions, meaning that the outcome variable can only take on a limited set of values. A coin flip has two outcomes. The sum of a pair of dice has 11 outcomes. The total electoral votes for the Democratic candidate has 539 possible outcomes. In the limit, we can also create continuous probability distributions which have an infinite number of possible outcomes. For example, the average height for an American male could be any real number between 0 inches and 100 inches. (Of course, a value anywhere near 0 or 100 is absurd. The point is that the average could be 68.564, 68.5643, 68.56432 68.564327, or any real number.)\nAll the characteristics for discrete probability distributions which we reviewed above apply just as much to continuous probability distributions. For example, we can create mathematical, empirical and posterior probability distributions for continuous outcomes just as we did for discrete outcomes.\nThe empirical distribution involves using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).\n\nShow the code# Use nhanes data set for this exercise, filter for adult and male.\n\nnhanes |&gt;\n  filter(sex == \"Male\", age &gt;= 18) |&gt;\n  select(height)|&gt;\n  drop_na() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                 binwidth = 1, \n                 color = \"white\")+\n  labs(title = \"Empirical Probability Distribution\",\n       subtitle = \"Height for adult men\",\n       x = \"Height (cm)\",\n       y = \"Probability\",caption = \"Source:NHANES\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels =\n                      scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMathematical distribution is completely based on mathematical formula and assumptions, as in the coin flip example. In the coin-flip example, we assumed that the coin was perfectly fair, meaning that the probability of landing on heads or tails was equal. In this case, we make three assumptions. First, a male height follows a Normal distribution. Second, the average height of men is 175 cm. Third, the standard deviation for male height is 9 cm. We can create a Normal distribution using the rnorm() function with these two parameter values.\n\nShow the code# Greater the n size, the smoother the graph. Shouldn't we use geom_density?\n\ntibble(height = rnorm(1000000, mean = 175, sd = 9)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = height)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                 binwidth = 1, \n                 color = \"white\")+\n  labs(title = \"Mathematical Probability Distribution\",\n       subtitle = \"Male height assuming a normal distribution with a mean of 175 cm and sd of 9 cm\",\n       x = \"Height (cm)\",\n       y = \"Probability\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels =\n                      scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, the Normal distribution which is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean described by this formula.\n\\[y_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\]\n\nEach value \\(y_i\\) is drawn from a Normal distribution with parameters \\(\\mu\\) for the mean and \\(\\sigma\\) for the standard deviation. If the assumptions are correct, then, as our sample size increases, the empirical probability distribution will look more and more like the mathematical distribution.\nThe posterior distribution for heights depends on the context. Are we considering all the adult men in America? In that case, our posterior would probably look a lot like the empirical distribution using NHANES data. If we are being asked about the distribution of heights among players in the NBA, then our posterior might look like:\n\nShow the codetibble(height = rnorm(100000, 200, 6)) |&gt; \n    ggplot(aes(x = height)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                   binwidth = 1, \n                   color = \"white\")+\n    labs(title = \"Posterior Probability Distribution\",\n         subtitle = \"My belief about the heights of professional basketball players\",\n         x = \"Height (cm)\",\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels =\n                           scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaveats:\n\nContinuous variables are a myth. Nothing that can be represented on a computer is truly continuous. Even something which appears continuous, like height, actually can only take on a (very large) set of discrete variables.\nThe math of continuous probability distributions can be tricky. Read a book on mathematical probability for all the messy details. Little of that matters in applied work.\nThe most important difference is that, with discrete distributions, it makes sense to estimate the probability of a specific outcome. What is the probability of rolling a 9? With continuous distributions, this makes no sense because there are an infinite number of possible outcomes. With continuous variables, we only estimate intervals.\n\nDon’t worry about the distinctions between discrete and continuous outcomes, or between the discrete and continuous probability distributions which we will use to summarize our beliefs about those outcomes. The basic intuition is the same in both cases.\n\n2.2.5 Joint distributions\n\nRecall that \\(P(\\text{coin})\\) is the probability distribution for the result of a coin toss. It includes two parts, the probability of heads (\\(\\rho_h\\)) and the probability of tails (\\(\\rho_t\\)). This is a univariate distribution because there is only one outcome, which can be heads or tails. If there is more than one outcome, then we have a joint distribution.\n\nJoint distributions are also mathematical objects that cover a set of outcomes, where each distinct outcome has a chance of occurring between 0 and 1 and the sum of all chances must equal 1. The key to a joint distribution is that it measures the chance that both outcome \\(a\\) from the set of events A and outcome \\(b\\) from the set of events B will occur. The notation is \\(P(A, B)\\).\nLet’s say that you are rolling two six-sided dice simultaneously. Dice 1 is weighted so that there is a 50% chance of rolling a 6 and a 10% chance of each of the other values. Dice 2 is weighted so there is a 50% chance of rolling a 5 and a 10% chance of rolling each of the other values. Let’s roll both dice 1,000 times. In previous examples involving two dice, we cared about the sum of results and not the outcomes of the first versus the second dice of each simulation. With a joint distributions, the outcomes for individual dice matter; so instead of 11 possible outcomes on the x-axis of our distribution plot (ranging from 2 to 12), we have 36 outcomes. Furthermore, a 2D probability distribution is not sufficient to represent all of the variables involved, so the joint distribution for this example is displayed using a 3D plot.\n\n\nShow the code# Revisit and clean up this code.\n\n# Step 1: Create and organize the data.\n\nmydata &lt;- tibble(die.1 = sample(1:6, size = 1000, prob =\n                                  c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5), replace = TRUE),\n                 die.2 = sample(1:6, size = 1000, prob =\n                                  c(0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.5, 0.1), replace = TRUE)) |&gt;\n          summarize(total = n(),\n                    .by = c(die.1, die.2))\n\ndie1_factor &lt;- as.factor(mydata$die.1)\ndie2_factor &lt;- as.factor(mydata$die.2)\n\n\n# Step 2: Create a ggplot object.\n\nmtplot &lt;-  ggplot(mydata) +\n              geom_point(aes(x = die1_factor, y = die2_factor, color = total)) +\n              scale_color_continuous(limits = c(0, 100)) +\n              labs(x = \"Dice 1\", y = \"Dice 2\") +\n              theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n\n\n# Step 3: Turn it into a 3D plot.

A doctor develops a test to determine if a random person has the disease. However, this test isn’t 100% accurate. There is an 80% probability of correctly returning positive if the person has the disease and 90% probability of correctly returning negative if the person does not have the disease.\nThe probability of a random person having the disease is 0.6. Since each person either has the disease or doesn’t (those are the only two possibilities), the probability that a person does not have the disease is \\(1 - 0.6 =  0.4\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a person has the disease, then we go up the top branch. The probability of an infected person testing positive is 0.8 because the test is 80% sure of correctly returning positive when the person has the disease.\nBy the same logic, if a person does not have the disease, we go down the bottom branch. The probability of the person incorrectly testing positive is 0.1.\n\nWe decide to go down the top branch if our random person has the disease. We go down the bottom branch if they do not. This is conditional probability. The probability of testing positive is dependent on whether the person has the disease.\nHow would you express this in statistical notation? \\(P(A|B)\\) is the same thing as the probability of A given B. \\(P(A|B)\\) means the probability of A if we know for sure the value of B. Note that \\(P(A|B)\\) is not the same thing as \\(P(B|A)\\).\nThere are three main categories of probability distributions: univariate, joint and condictional. \\(p(A)\\) is the probability distribution for event A. This is a univariate probability distribution because there is only one random variable. \\(p(A, B)\\) is the joint probability distribution of A and B. \\(p(A | B)\\) is the conditional probability distribution of A given that B has taken on a specific value. This is often written as \\(p(A | B = b)\\).",

    "text": "2.3 Two models\n\n\n\nThe simplest possible setting for inference involves two models — meaning two possible states of the world — and two outcomes from an experiment. Imagine that there is a disease — Probophobia, an irrational fear of probability — which you either have or don’t have. We don’t know if you have the diseases, but we assume that these are the only two possibilities.\nWe also have a test which is 99% accurate when given to a person who has Probophobia. Unfortunately, the test is only 50% accurate for people who do not have Probophobia. In this experiment, there only two possible outcomes: a positive or a negative result on the test.\nQuestion: If you test positive, what is the probability that you have Probophobia?\nMore generally, we are estimating a conditional probability. Conditional on the outcome of a positive test, what is the probability that you have Probophobia? Mathematically, we want:\n\\[ P(\\text{Probophobia | Test = Postive} ) \\]\nTo answer this question, we need to use the tools of joint and conditional probability from earlier in the Chapter. We begin by building, by hand, the joint distribution of the possible models (you have the Probophobia or you do not) and of the possible outcomes (you test positive or negative). Building the joint distribution involves assuming that each model is true and then creating the distribution of outcomes which might occur if that assumption is true.\nFor example, assume you have Probophobia. There is then a 99% chance that you test positive and a 1% chance you test negative. Similarly, if we assume that the second model is true — i.e., that you don’t have Probophobia — then there is 50% chance you test positive and a 50% you chance negative. Of course, for you (or any individual) we do not know for sure what is happening. We do not know if you have the disease. We do not know what your test will show. But we can use these relationships to construct the joint distribution.\n\nShow the codeset.seed(9)\n\n\n\n\nShow the code# Pipes generally start with tibbles, so we start with a tibble which just\n# includes an ID variable. We don't really use ID. It is just handy for getting\n# organized. We call this object `jd_disease`, where the `jd` stands for\n# joint distribution.\n\nsims &lt;- 10000\n\njd_disease &lt;- tibble(ID = 1:sims, have_disease = rep(c(TRUE, FALSE), 5000)) |&gt;\n  mutate(positive_test =\n           if_else(have_disease,\n                   map_int(have_disease, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = 0.99)),\n                   map_int(have_disease, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 1, p = 0.5))))\n\n\n\njd_disease\n\n# A tibble: 10,000 × 3\n      ID have_disease positive_test\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;                &lt;int&gt;\n 1     1 TRUE                     1\n 2     2 FALSE                    1\n 3     3 TRUE                     1\n 4     4 FALSE                    1\n 5     5 TRUE                     1\n 6     6 FALSE                    0\n 7     7 TRUE                     1\n 8     8 FALSE                    1\n 9     9 TRUE                     1\n10    10 FALSE                    0\n# ℹ 9,990 more rows\n\n\nThe first step is to simply create an tibble that consists of the simulated data we need to plot our distribution. Keep in mind that in the setting we have two different probabilities and they are completely separate from each other and we want to keep the two probabilities and the disease results in two and only two columns so that we can graph using the ggplot() function. And that’s why we used the rep and seq functions when creating the table, we used the seq function to set the sequence we want, which in this case is only two numbers, 0.01 (99% accuracy for testing negative if no disease, therefore 1% for testing positive if no disease) and 0.5 (50% accuracy for testing positive/negative if have disease), then we used the rep functions to repeat the process 10,000 times for each probability, in total 20,000 times. Note that this number “20,000” also represents the number of observations in our simulated data, we simulated 20,000 results from testing, where 10,000 results from the have-disease group and 10,000 for the no-disease group, we often use the capital N to represent the population, in this simulated data \\(N=20,000\\).\nPlot the joint distribution:\n\nShow the code# Use discrete for FALSE and TRUE\n\njd_disease |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(positive_test), \n             y = as.factor(have_disease))) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = .2) +\n  labs(title = \"Unnormalized Distribution of Test Results and Disease Status\",\n       subtitle = \"Many False results in have disease than no disease\",\n       x = \"Test Result\",\n       y = \"Disease Status\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(0, 1), \n                   labels = c(\"Negative\", \"Positive\")) +\n  scale_y_discrete(breaks = c(FALSE, TRUE), \n                   labels = c(\"No Disease\", \"Have Disease\")) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a joint distribution displayed in 3D. Instead of using the “jitter” feature in R to unstack the dots, we are using a 3D plot to visualize the number of dots in each box. The number of people who correctly test negative is far greater than of the other categories. The 3D plot shows the total number of cases for each section (True positive, True negative, False positive, False negative),the 3D bar coming from those combinations. Now,pay attention to the two rows of the 3D graph, if you trying to add up the length of the 3D bar for the top two sections and the bottom two sections, they should be equal to each other, where each have 10,000 case. This is because we simulate the experience in two independent and separate world one in the have-disease world and one in the no-disease world.\n\nShow the code# Pile up the dots in one point.\n# Later use for rayshader\n\njd_disease_plot &lt;- jd_disease |&gt;\n  summarize(total = n(),\n            .by = c(have_disease, positive_test)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(positive_test),\n             y = as.factor(have_disease),\n             color = total)) +\n    geom_point(size = 5) +\n    scale_color_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000)) +\n    scale_x_discrete(breaks = c(0, 1),\n                     labels = c(\"Negative\", \"Positive\")) +\n    scale_y_discrete(breaks = c(FALSE, TRUE),\n                     labels = c(\"No Disease\", \"Have Disease\")) +\n    labs(x = \"Test Result\",\n         y = \"Disease Status\",\n         title = \"Unnormalized Distribution of Results and Status\",\n         subtitle = \"Many False results in have disease than no disease\",\n         color = \"Cases\") +\n    theme_classic() +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n          title = element_text(size = 7),\n          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n          axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7))\n\nplot_gg(jd_disease_plot,\n        width = 3.5,\n        zoom = 0.65,\n        theta = 25,\n        phi = 30,\n        sunangle = 225,\n        soliddepth = -0.5,\n        windowsize = c(2048, 1536))\n\n# Save the plot as an image\nrgl::rgl.snapshot(\"probability/images/disease.png\")\n\n# Close the RGL device\nrgl::close3d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Section is called “Two Models” because, for each person, there are two possible states of the world: have the disease or not have the disease. By assumption, there are no other outcomes. We call these two possible states of the world “models,” even though they are very simple models.\nIn addition to the two models, we have two possible results of our experiment on a given person: test positive or test negative. Again, this is an assumption. We do not allow for any other outcome. In coming sections, we will look at more complex situations where we consider more than two models and more than two possible results of the experiment. In the meantime, we have built the unnormalized joint distribution for models and results. This is a key point! Look back earlier in this Chapter for discussions about both unnormalized distributions and joint distributions.\nWe want to analyze these plots by looking at different slices. For instance, let’s say that you have tested positive for the disease. Since the test is not always accurate, you cannot be 100% certain that you have it. We isolate the slice where the test result equals 1 (meaning positive).\n\nShow the codejd_disease |&gt; \n  filter(positive_test == 1)\n\n# A tibble: 7,484 × 3\n      ID have_disease positive_test\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;lgl&gt;                &lt;int&gt;\n 1     1 TRUE                     1\n 2     2 FALSE                    1\n 3     3 TRUE                     1\n 4     4 FALSE                    1\n 5     5 TRUE                     1\n 6     7 TRUE                     1\n 7     8 FALSE                    1\n 8     9 TRUE                     1\n 9    11 TRUE                     1\n10    12 FALSE                    1\n# ℹ 7,474 more rows\n\n\nMost people who test positive are infected This is a result for common diseases like cold.

In this case, we are focusing on one slice of the probability distribution where the test result was positive. There are two disease outcomes: positive or negative. By isolating a section, we are looking at a conditional distribution. Conditional on a positive test, you can visualize the likelihood of actually having the disease versus not.\nNow recalled the question we asked at the start of the session:\nIf you test positive, what is the probability that you have Probophobia?\nBy looking at the posterior graph we just create, we can answer this question easily:\nWith a positive test, you can be almost 70% sure that you have Probophobia, however there is a good chance of about 30% that you receive a false positive, so don’t worry too much, there is still about a third of hope that you get the wrong result\nNow let’s consider the manipulation of this posterior, here is another question.

    "text": "2.4 Three models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImagine that your friend gives you a bag with two marbles. There could either be two white marbles, two black marbles, or one of each color. Thus, the bag could contain 0% white marbles, 50% white marbles, or 100% white marbles. The proportion, \\(p\\), of white marbles could be, respectively, 0, 0.5, or 1.\nQuestion: What is the chance of the bag contains exactly two white marbles, given that when we selected the marbles three times, every time we select a white marble?\n\\[ P(\\text{2 White Marbles in bag | White Marbles Sampled = 3} ) \\] Just as during the Probophobia models, in order to answer this question, we need to start up with the simulated data and then graph out the joint distribution of this scenario because we need to consider all possible outcomes of this model, and then based on the joint distribution we can slice out the the part we want (the conditional distribution) in the end making a posterior graph as well as normalizing it to see the probability.\nStep 1: Simulate the data into an tibble\nLet’s say you take a marble out of the bag, record whether it’s black or white, then return it to the bag. You repeat this three times, observing the number of white marbles you see out of three trials. You could get three whites, two whites, one white, or zero whites as a result of this trial. We have three models (three different proportions of white marbles in the bag) and four possible experimental results. Let’s create 3,000 draws from this joint distribution:\n\nShow the code# Create the joint distribution of the number of white marbles in the bag\n# (in_bag) and the number of white marbles pulled out in the sample (in_sample),\n# one-by-one. in_bag takes three possible values: 0, 1 and 2, corresponding to\n# zero, one and two white marbles potentially in the bag.\n\nset.seed(3)\nsims &lt;- 10000\n\n# We also start off with a tibble. It just makes things easier\n\njd_marbles &lt;- tibble(ID = 1:sims) |&gt; \n  \n  # For each row, we (randomly!) determine the number of white marbles in the\n  # bag. We do not know why the `as.integer()` hack is necessary. Shouldn't\n  # `map_int()` automatically coerce the result of `sample()` into an integer?\n  \n  mutate(in_bag = map_int(ID, ~ as.integer(sample(c(0, 1, 2), \n                                                  size = 1)))) |&gt;\n  \n  # Depending on the number of white marbles in the bag, we randomly draw out 0,\n  # 1, 2, or 3 white marbles in our experiment. We need `p = ./2` to transform\n  # the number of white marbles into the probability of drawing out a white\n  # marble in a single draw. That probability is either 0%, 50% or 100%.\n  \n  mutate(in_sample = map_int(in_bag, ~ rbinom(n = 1, \n                                              size = 3, \n                                              p = ./2))) \n\njd_marbles\n\n# A tibble: 10,000 × 3\n      ID in_bag in_sample\n   &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;     &lt;int&gt;\n 1     1      0         0\n 2     2      1         3\n 3     3      2         3\n 4     4      1         1\n 5     5      2         3\n 6     6      2         3\n 7     7      1         0\n 8     8      2         3\n 9     9      0         0\n10    10      1         2\n# ℹ 9,990 more rows\n\n\nStep 2: Plot the joint distribution:\n\nShow the code# The distribution is unnormalized. All we see is the number of outcomes in each\n# \"bucket.\" Although it is never stated clearly, we are assuming that there is\n# an equal likelihood of 0, 1 or 2 white marbles in the bag.\n\njd_marbles |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = in_sample, y = in_bag)) +\n    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5) +\n    labs(title = \"Black and White Marbles\",\n         subtitle = \"More white marbles in bag mean more white marbles selected\",\n         x = \"White Marbles Selected\",\n         y = \"White Marbles in the Bag\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1, 2)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the 3D visualization:\n\nShow the code# Same process, first condense point plot to a single plot, then use plot_gg make it 3d and \n# give height.\n\njd_marbles_plot &lt;- jd_marbles |&gt;\n  summarize(total = n(), \n            .by = c(in_bag, in_sample)) |&gt; \n  mutate(in_sample = as.factor(in_sample)) |&gt; \n  mutate(in_bag = as.factor(in_bag)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = in_sample, y = in_bag, color = total)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    scale_color_continuous(limits = c(0, 3500)) +\n    labs(x = \"White Marbles Selected\",\n         y = \"White Marbles in the Bag\",\n         title = \"Black and White Marbles\",\n         subtitle = \"More white marbles in bag mean more are selected\",\n         color = \"Count\") +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n          title = element_text(size = 7),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 6),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 6))\n\nplot_gg(jd_marbles_plot,\n         width = 4,\n         zoom = 0.75,\n         theta = 25,\n         phi = 30,\n         sunangle = 225,\n         soliddepth = -0.5,\n         raytrace = FALSE,\n         windowsize = c(2048,1536))\n\n# Save the plot as an image\nrgl::rgl.snapshot(\"probability/images/marbles.png\")\n\n# Close the RGL device\nrgl::close3d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe y-axes of both the scatterplot and the 3D visualization are labeled “Number of White Marbles in the Bag.” Each value on the y-axis is a model, a belief about the world. For instance, when the model is 0, we have no white marbles in the bag, meaning that none of the marbles we pull out in the sample will be white.\nNow recalls the question, we essentially only care about the fourth column in the joint distribution (x-axis=3) because the question is asking us to create a conditional distribution given that fact that 3 marbles were selected. Therefore, we could isolate the slice where the result of the simulation involves three white marbles and zero black ones. Here is the unnormalized probability distribution.\nStep 3: Plot the unnormalized conditional distribution.\n\nShow the code# The key step is the filter. Creating a conditional distribution from a joint\n# distribution is the same thing as filtering that joint distribution for a\n# specific value. A conditional distribution is a \"slice\" of the joint\n# distribution, and we take that slice with filter().\n\njd_marbles |&gt; \n  filter(in_sample == 3) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(in_bag)) +\n    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = \"white\") +\n    labs(title = \"Unnormalized Conditional Distribution\",\n         subtitle = \"Number of white marbles in bag given that three were selected in the sample\",\n         x = \"Number of White Marbles in the Bag\",\n         y = \"Count\") +\n    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 2)) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1, 2)) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Plot the normalize posterior distribution. Next, let’s normalize the distribution.\n\nShow the codejd_marbles |&gt; \n  filter(in_sample == 3) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(in_bag)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))), \n                   binwidth = 0.5, \n                   color = \"white\") +\n    labs(title = \"Posterior Probability Distribution\",\n         subtitle = \"Number of white marbles in bag given that three were selected in the sample\",\n         x = \"Number of White Marbles in the Bag\",\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 2)) +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 1, 2)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = \n                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot makes sense because when all three marbles you draw out of the bag are white, there is a pretty good chance that there are no black marbles in the bag. But you can’t be certain! It is possible to draw three white even if the bag contains one white and one black. However, it is impossible that there are zero white marbles in the bag.\nLastly let’s answer the question: What is the chance of the bag contains exactly two white marbles, given that when we selected the white marbles three times, everytime we select a white marble?\nAnswer: As the Posterior Probability Distribution shows (x-axis=2), the chance of the bag contains exactly two white marbles given that we select 3 white marbles out of three tries is about 85%.",

    "text": "2.5 N models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssume that there is a coin with \\(\\rho_h\\). We guarantee that there are only 11 possible values of \\(\\rho_h\\): \\(0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 0.9, 1\\). In other words, there are 11 possible models, 11 things which might be true about the world. This is just like situations we have previously discussed, except that there are more models to consider.\nWe are going to run an experiment in which you flip the coin 20 times and record the number of heads. What does this result tell you about the value of \\(\\rho_h\\)? Ultimately, we will want to calculate a posterior distribution of \\(\\rho_h\\), which is written as p(\\(\\rho_h\\)).\nQuestion: What is the probability of getting exactly 8 heads out of 20 tosses?\nTo start, it is useful to consider all the things which might happen if, for example, \\(\\rho_h = 0.4\\). Fortunately, the R functions for simulating random variables makes this easy.\n\nShow the codeset.seed(9)\n\nsims &lt;- 1000\n\nx &lt;- tibble(ID = 1: sims, heads = rbinom(n = 1000, size = 20, p = 0.4)) \n\nx |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(heads)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n                   bins = 50) + \n    labs(title = \"Empirical Distribution of Number of Heads\",\n         subtitle = \"Based on 1,000 simulations with p = 0.4\",\n         x = \"Number of Heads out of 20 Tosses\",\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = \n                         scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, notice that many different things can happen! Even if we know, for certain, that \\(\\rho_h = 0.4\\), many outcomes are possible. Life is remarkably random. Second, the most likely result of the experiment is 8 heads, as we would expect. Third, we have transformed the raw counts of how many times each total appeared into a probability distribution. Sometimes, however, it is convenient to just keep track of the raw counts. The shape of the figure is the same in both cases.\n\nShow the codex |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(heads)) +\n     geom_histogram(bins = 50) + \n    labs(title = \"Total Count of the Number of Heads Out of 20 Tosses\",\n         subtitle = \"Based on 1,000 simulations with p = 0.4\",\n         x = \"Number of Heads out of 20 Tosses\",\n         y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEither way, the figures show what would have happened if that model — that \\(\\rho_h = 0.4\\) — were true.\nWe can do the same thing for all 11 possible models, calculating what would happen if each of them were true. This is somewhat counterfactual since only one of them can be true. Yet this assumption does allow us to create the joint distribution of models which might be true and of data which our experiment might generate. Let’s simplify this as p(models, data), although you should keep the precise meaning in mind.\n\nShow the code# sims size depends on your data size, or the number in rep().\n\nset.seed(10)\n\nsims &lt;- 11000\n\njd_coin &lt;- tibble(ID = 1:sims, p = rep(seq(0, 1, 0.1), 1000)) |&gt;\n  mutate(heads = map_int(p, ~ rbinom(n = 1, size = 20, p = .)))\n\njd_coin |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y = p, x = heads)) +\n    geom_jitter(alpha = 0.1) +\n    labs(title = \"Empirical Distribution of Number of Heads\",\n         subtitle = expression(paste(\"Based on simulations with various values of \", rho[h])),\n         x = \"Number of Heads out of 20 Tosses\",\n         y = expression(rho[h])) +\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.1)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is the 3D version of the same plot.\n\nShow the code# Condese point and make rayshader plot.\n\njd_coin_plot &lt;- jd_coin |&gt; \n  summarize(total = n(), \n            .by = c(p, heads)) |&gt; \n  mutate(p = as.factor(p)) |&gt; \n  mutate(heads = as.factor(heads)) |&gt; \n  ggplot() +\n    geom_point(aes(x = heads, y = p, color = total)) +\n    scale_color_continuous(limits = c(0, 1000)) +\n    theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n    labs(x = \"Number of Heads out of 20 Tosses\",\n         y = expression(rho[h]),\n         title = \"Empirical Distribution of Number of Heads\",\n         subtitle = expression(paste(\"Based on simulations with various values of \", \n                                     rho[h]))) +\n    theme(title = element_text(size = 9),\n          axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n          axis.title.y = element_text(size = 7),\n          legend.position = \"none\")\n\nplot_gg(jd_coin_plot,\n       width = 3.5,\n         zoom = 0.65,\n         theta = 25,\n         phi = 30,\n         sunangle = 225,\n         soliddepth = -0.5,\n         raytrace = FALSE,\n         windowsize = c(2048,1536))\n\n# Save the plot as an image\nrgl::rgl.snapshot(\"probability/images/coin.png\")\n\n# Close the RGL device\nrgl::close3d()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn both of these diagrams, we see 11 models and 21 outcomes. We don’t really care about the p(\\(models\\), \\(data\\)), the joint distribution of the models-which-might-be-true and the data-which-our-experiment-might-generate. Instead, we want to estimate \\(p\\), the unknown parameter which determines the probability that this coin will come up heads when tossed. The joint distribution alone can’t tell us that. We created the joint distribution before we had even conducted the experiment. It is our creation, a tool which we use to make inferences. Instead, we want the conditional distribution, p(\\(models\\) | \\(data = 8\\)). We have the results of the experiment. What do those results tell us about the probability distribution of \\(p\\)?\nTo answer this question, we simply take a vertical slice from the joint distribution at the point of the x-axis corresponding to the results of the experiment.\nThis animation shows what we want to do with joint distributions. We take a slice (the red one), isolate it, rotate it to look at the conditional distribution, normalize it (change the values along the current z-axis from counts to probabilities), then observe the resulting posterior.\n\nThis is the only part of the joint distribution that we care about. We aren’t interested in what the object looks like where, for example, the number of heads is 11. That portion is irrelevant because we observed 8 heads, not 11. By using the filter function on the simulation tibble we created, we can conclude that there are a total of 465 times in our simulation in which 8 heads were observed.\nAs we would expect, most of the time when 8 coin tosses came up heads, the value of \\(p\\) was 0.4. But, on numerous occasions, it was not. It is quite common for a value of \\(p\\) like 0.3 or 0.5 to generate 8 heads. Consider:\n\nShow the codejd_coin |&gt; \n  filter(heads == 8) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(p)) +\n    geom_bar() +\n    labs(title = expression(paste(\"Values of \", rho[h], \" Associated with 8 Heads\")),\n         x = expression(paste(\"Assumed value of \", rho[h], \" in simulation\")),\n         y = \"Count\") +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet this is a distribution of raw counts. It is an unnormalized density. To turn it into a proper probability density (i.e., one in which the sum of the probabilities across possible outcomes sums to one) we just divide everything by the total number of observations.\n\nShow the codejd_coin |&gt; \n  filter(heads == 8) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = p)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n                   bins = 50) + \n    labs(title = expression(paste(\"Posterior Probability Distribution of \", rho[h])),\n         x = expression(paste(\"Possible values for \", rho[h])),\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0.2, 0.7, by = 0.1)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = \n                        scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution:\nThe most likely value of \\(\\rho_h\\) is 0.4, as before. But, it is much more likely that \\(p\\) is either 0.3 or 0.5. And there is about an 8% chance that \\(\\rho_h \\ge 0.6\\).\nYou might be wondering: what is the use of a model? Well, let’s say we toss the coin 20 times and get 8 heads again. Given this result, we can ask: What is the probability that future samples of 20 flips will result in 10 or more heads?\nThere are three main ways you could go about solving this problem with simulations.\nThe first wrong way to do this is assuming that \\(\\rho_h\\) is certain because we observed 8 heads after 20 tosses.

    "text": "2.6 Cardinal Virtues\nThe four Cardinal Virtues are Wisdom, Justice, Courage, and Temperance. Because data science is, ultimately, a moral act, we use these virtues to guide our work. Every data science project begins with a question.\n\nWisdom starts by creating the Preceptor Table. What data, if we had it, would allow us to answer our question easily? If the Preceptor Table has one outcome, then the model is predictive. If it has more than one (potential) outcome, then the model is causal. We then explore the data we have. You can never look too closely at your data. Key question: Are the data we have close enough to the data we want (i.e., the Preceptor Table) that we can consider both as coming from the same population? If not, we can’t proceed further. Key in making that decision is the assumption of validity. Do the columns in the Preceptor Table match the columns in the data?\nJustice starts with the Population Table – the data we want to have (i.e., the Preceptor Table), the data which we actually have, and all the other data from that same population. Each row of the Population Table is defined by a unique Unit/Time combination. We explore three key issues about the Population Table. First, does the relationship among the variables demonstrate stability, meaning is the model stable across different time periods? Second, are the rows associated with the data and, separately, the rows associated with the Preceptor Table representative of all the units from the population? Third, for causal models only, we consider unconfoundedness.\nCourage allows us to explore different models. Justice gave us the Population Table. Courage creates the data generating mechanism. We begin with the basic mathematical structure of the model. With that structure in mind, we decide which variables to include. We estimate the values of the unknown parameters. We avoid hypothesis tests. We check our models for consistency with the data we have. We select one model.\nTemperance guides us in the use of the model we have created to answer the questions with which we began. We create posteriors of quantities of interest. We should be modest in the claims we make. Humility is important. The posteriors we create are never the “truth.” The assumptions we made to create the model are never perfect. Yet decisions made with flawed posteriors are almost always better than decisions made without them.\n\n\n2.6.1 Wisdom\n\n\n\n\nWisdom.\n\n\n\n\nWisdom requires the creation of a Preceptor Table, some exploratory data analysis, and a determination, using the concept of validity, as to whether or not we can (reasonably!) assume that the two come from the same population.\n\nWisdom helps us decide if we can even hope to answer our question with the data that we have.\n\nA Preceptor Table is smallest possible table with rows and columns such that, if there is no missing data, our question is easy to answer.\n\nOne key aspect of this Preceptor Table is whether or not we need more than one potential outcome in order to calculate our estimand. For example, if we want to know the causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers on attitude toward immigration then we need a causal model, one which estimates that attitude for each person under both treatment and control. The Preceptor Table would require two columns for the outcome. If, on the other hand, we only want to predict someone’s attitude, or compare one person’s attitude to another person’s, then we would only need a Preceptor Table with one column for the outcome.\nEvery model is predictive, in the sense that, if we give you new data — and it is drawn from the same population — then you can create a predictive forecast. But only a subset of those models are causal, meaning that, for a given individual, you can change the value of one input and figure out what the new output would be and then, from that, calculate the causal effect by looking at the difference between two potential outcomes.\nWith prediction, all we care about is forecasting \\(Y\\) given \\(X\\) on some as-yet-unseen data. But there is no notion of “manipulation” in such models. We don’t pretend that, for Joe, we could turn variable \\(X\\) from a value of \\(5\\) to a value of \\(6\\) by just turning some knob and, by doing so, cause Joe’s value of \\(Y\\) to change from \\(17\\) to \\(23\\). We can compare two people (or two groups of people), one with \\(X\\) equal to \\(5\\) and one with \\(X\\) equal to \\(6\\), and see how they differ in \\(Y\\). The basic assumption of predictive models is that there is only one possible \\(Y\\) for Joe. There are not, by assumption, two possible values for \\(Y\\) for Joe, one if \\(X\\) equals \\(5\\) and another if \\(X\\) equals \\(6\\). The Preceptor Table has a single column under \\(Y\\) if that is all we need to answer the question.\nWith causal inference, however, we can consider the case of Joe with \\(X = 5\\) and Joe with \\(X = 6\\). The same mathematical model can be used. And both models can be used for prediction, for estimating what the value of \\(Y\\) will be for a yet-unseen observation with a specified value for \\(X\\). But, in this case, instead of only a single column in the Preceptor Table for \\(Y\\), we have at least two (and possibly many) such columns, one for each of the potential outcomes under consideration.\nThe difference between predictive models and causal models is that the former have one column for the outcome variable and the latter have more than one column.\nSecond, we look at the data we have and perform an exploratory data analysis, an EDA. You can never look at your data too much. The most important variable is the one we most want to understand/explain/predict. In the models we create in later chapters, this variable will go on the left-hand side of our mathematical equations. Some academic fields refer to this as the “dependent variable.” Others use terms like “response” or “outcome.” Whatever the terminology, we need to explore the distribution of this variable, its min/max/range, its mean and median, its standard deviation, and so on.Gelman, Hill, and Vehtari (2020) write:\n\nMost important is that the data you are analyzing should map to the research question you are trying to answer. This sounds obvious but is often overlooked or ignored because it can be inconvenient. Optimally, this means that the outcome measure should accurately reflect the phenomenon of interest, the model should include all relevant predictors, and the model should generalize to the cases to which it will be applied.\n\n\nFor example, with regard to the outcome variable, a model of incomes will not necessarily tell you about patterns of total assets. A model of test scores will not necessarily tell you about child intelligence or cognitive development. …\n\nWe care about other variables as well, especially those that are most correlated/connected with the outcome variable. The more time that we spend looking at these variables, the more likely we are to create a useful model.\nThird, the (almost always imaginary) population is key. We need the data we want — the Preceptor Table — and the data we have to be similar enough that we can consider them as all having come from the same statistical population. From Wikipedia:\n\nIn statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all opening hands in all the poker games in Las Vegas tomorrow).\n\nMechanically, assuming that the Preceptor Table and the data are drawn from the same population is the same thing as “stacking” the two on top of each other. For that to make sense, the variables must mean the same thing — at least mostly — in both cases. This is the assumption of validity.\nIf we assume that the data we have is drawn from the same population as the data in the Preceptor Table is drawn from, then we can use information about the former to make inferences about the latter. We can combine the Preceptor Table and the data into a single Population Table. If we can’t do that, if we can’t assume that the two sources come from the same population, then we can’t use our data to answer our questions. The heart of Wisdom is knowing when to walk away. As John Tukey noted:\n\nThe combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.\n\n\n2.6.2 Justice\n\n\n\n\nJustice.\n\n\n\n\nJustice concerns four topics: the Population Table, stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness.\n\nThe Population Table includes a row for each unit/time combination in the underlying population from which both the Preceptor Table and the data are drawn. It can be constructed if the validity assumption is (mostly) true. It includes all the rows from the Preceptor Table. It also includes the rows from the data set. It usually has other rows as well, rows which represent unit/time combinations from other parts of the population.\nThere are three key issues to explore in any Population Table: stability, representativeness and unconfoundedness.\nStability means that the relationship between the columns in the Population Table is the same for three categories of rows: the data, the Preceptor Table, and the larger population from which both are drawn.\nNever forget the temporal nature of almost all real data science problems. Our Preceptor Table will focus on rows for today or for the near future. The data we have will always be from before now. We must almost always assume that the future will be like the past in order to use data from the past to make predictions about the future.\nRepresentativeness, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationship, among the rows in the Population Table. The first is between the Preceptor Table and the other rows. The second is between our data and the other rows. Ideally, we would like both the Preceptor Table and our data to be random samples from the population. Sadly, this is almost never the case.\nValidity is about the columns in our Population Table. Stability and representativeness are about the rows.\nUnconfoundedness means that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes, when we condition on pre-treatment covariates. This assumption is only relevant for causal models. We describe a model as “confounded” if this is not true. The easiest way to ensure unconfoundedness is to assign treatment randomly.\n\n2.6.3 Courage\n\n\n\n\nCourage.\n\n\n\n\nCourage begins with the exploration and testing of different models. It concludes with the creation of the Data Generating Mechanism.\n\nCourage begins by a discussion of the functional form we will be using. This is usually straight-forward because it follows directly from the type of the outcome variable: continuous implies a linear model, binary implies logistic, and more than two categories suggests multinomial logistic. We provide the mathematical formula for this model, using y and x as variables. The rest of the discussion is broken up into three sections: “Models,” “Tests,” and “Data Generating Mechanism.”\nCourage requires math.\nThe three languages of data science are words, math and code, and the most important of these is code.\nWe need to explain the structure of our model using all three languages, but we need Courage to implement the model in code.\nCourage requires us to take the general mathematical formula and then make it specific. Which variables should we include in the model and which do we exclude? Every data science project involves the creation of several models, each with one or more unknown parameters.\nCode allows us to “fit” a model by estimating the values of the unknown parameters. Sadly, we can never know the true values of these parameters. But, like all good statisticians, we can express our uncertain knowledge in the form of posterior probability distributions. With those distributions, we can compare the actual values of the outcome variable with the “fitted” or “predicted” results of the model. We can examine the “residuals,” the difference between the fitted and actual values.\nA parameter is something which does not exist in the real world. (If it did, or could, then it would be data.) Instead, a parameter is a mental abstraction, a building block which we will use to to help us accomplish our true goal: To replace at least some of the questions marks in the actual Preceptor Table. Since parameters are mental abstractions, we will always be uncertain as to their value, however much data we might collect.\nRandomness is intrinsic to this fallen world.\nNull hypothesis testing is a mistake. There is only the data, the models and the summaries therefrom.\nThe final step of Courage is to select the final model, the Data Generating Mechanism.\n\n2.6.4 Temperance\n\n\n\n\nTemperance.\n\n\n\n\nTemperance uses the Data Generating Mechanism to answer the specific question with which we began. Humility reminds us that this answer is always a lie. We can also explore the general question by using the DGM to calculate many similar quantities of interest, displaying the results graphically.\n\nThere are few more important concepts in statistics and data science than the Data Generating Mechanism. Our data — the data that we collect and see — has been generated by the complexity and confusion of the world. God’s own mechanism has brought His data to us. Our job is to build a model of that process, to create, on the computer, a mechanism which generates fake data consistent with the data which we see. With that DGM, we can answer any question which we might have. In particular, with the DGM, we provide predictions of data we have not seen and estimates of the uncertainty associated with those predictions. We can fill in the missing values in the Preceptor Table and then, easily, calculate all Quantities of Interest.\nJustice gave us the Population Table. Courage created the DGM, the fitted model. Temperance will guide us in its use.\nHaving created (and checked) a model, we now use the model to answer questions. Models are made for use, not for beauty. The world confronts us. Make decisions we must. Our decisions will be better ones if we use high quality models to help make them.\nSadly, our models are never as good as we would like them to be. First, the world is intrinsically uncertain.\n\n\n\n\nDonald Rumsfeld.\n\n\n\n\nThere are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns. That is to say, we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we do not know we do not know. – Donald Rumsfeld\n\nWhat we really care about is data we haven’t seen yet, mostly data from tomorrow. But what if the world changes, as it always does? If it doesn’t change much, maybe we are OK. If it changes a lot, then what good will our model be? In general, the world changes some. That means that our forecasts are more uncertain that a naive use of our model might suggest.\nIn Temperance, the key distinction is between the true posterior distribution — what we will call “Preceptor’s Posterior” — and the estimated posterior distribution. Recall our discussion from Section 2.1. Imagine that every assumption we made in Wisdom and Justice were correct, that we correctly understand every aspect of how the world works. We still would not know the unknown value we are trying to estimate — recall the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference — but the posterior we created would be perfect. That is Preceptor’s Posterior. Sadly, even if our estimated posterior is, very close to Preceptor’s Posterior, we can never be sure of that fact, because we can never know the truth, never be certain that all the assumptions we made are correct.\nEven worse, we must always worry that our estimated posterior, despite all the work we put into creating it, is far from the truth. We, therefore, must be cautious in our use of that posterior, humble in our claims about its accuracy. Using our posterior, despite its faults, is better than not using it. Yet it is, at best, a distorted map of reality, a glass through which we must look darkly. Use your posteriors with humility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGelman, Andrew, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari. 2020. Regression and Other Stories.

Or, as we data scientists say, sampled?\nIn Chapter 2, we learned about probability, the framework for quantifying uncertainty. In this chapter, we will learn about sampling, the beginning of our journey toward inference. When we sample, we take some units from a population. With the data collected via sampling, we use inference to create statistical models. With such models, we can answer questions.\nWe always use the Cardinal Virtues. Wisdom helps us to clarify the questions with which we begin. We build the Preceptor Table which, if no data were missing, would allow us to answer the question. We check for validity.

    "text": "3.1.1 Using the shovel method once\nInstead of performing an exhaustive count, let’s insert a shovel into the urn and remove \\(5 \\cdot 10 = 50\\) beads. We are taking a sample of the total population of beads.\n\n\n\n\nInserting a shovel into the urn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoving 50 beads from the urn.\n\n\n\nObserve that 17 of the 50 sampled beads are red and thus \\(17/50 = 0.34 = 34\\%\\) of the shovel’s beads are red. We can view the proportion of beads that are red in this shovel as a guess at the proportion of beads that are red in the entire urn. While not as exact as doing an exhaustive count of all the beads in the urn, our guess of 34% took much less time and energy to make.\nRecall that \\(\\rho\\) is the true value of the proportion of red beads. There is only one \\(\\rho\\). A guess at the proportion of red beads is known as \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) (pronounced p hat), where \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) is the estimated value of \\(\\rho\\). There are many ways to estimate \\(\\rho\\), each leading to a (potentially) different \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\). The 34% value for \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) came from taking this sample. But, if we used the shovel again, we would probably come up with a different \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\). There are many possible \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\)’s. You and I will often differ in our estimates. We might each have a different \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) even though we agree that there is only one \\(\\rho\\).\nStart this activity over again from the beginning, placing the 50 beads back into the urn. Would a second sample include exactly 17 red beads? Maybe, but probably not.\nWhat if we repeated this activity many times? Would our guess at the proportion of the urn’s beads that are red, \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\), be exactly 34% every time? Surely not.\nLet’s repeat this exercise with the help of 33 groups of friends to understand how the value of \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) varies across 33 independent trials.\n\n3.1.2 Using the shovel 33 times\nEach of our 33 groups of friends will do the following:\n\nUse the shovel to remove 50 beads each.\nCount the number of red beads and compute the proportion of the 50 beads that are red.\nReturn the beads into the urn.\nMix the contents of the urn to not let a previous group’s results influence the next group’s.\n\nEach of our 33 groups of friends make note of their proportion of red beads from their sample collected. Each group then marks their proportion of their 50 beads that were red in the appropriate bin in a hand-drawn histogram as seen below.\n\n\n\n\nConstructing a histogram of proportions.\n\n\n\nHistograms allow us to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable. In particular, where the center of the values falls and how the values vary. A partially completed histogram of the first 10 out of 33 groups of friends’ results can be seen in the figure below.\n\n\n\n\nHand-drawn histogram of first 10 out of 33 proportions.\n\n\n\nObserve the following details in the histogram:\n\nAt the low end, one group removed 50 beads from the urn with proportion red between 0.20 and 0.25.\nAt the high end, another group removed 50 beads from the urn with proportion red between 0.45 and 0.5 red.\nHowever, the most commonly occurring proportions were around 0.4 red, right in the middle of the distribution.\nThe distribution is somewhat bell-shaped.\n\ntactile_sample_urn saves the results from our 33 groups of friends.\n\n\n# A tibble: 33 × 4\n   group           red_beads prop_red group_ID\n   &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Yuki, Harry            21     0.42        1\n 2 Nam, Joshua            19     0.38        2\n 3 Katie, Anthony         20     0.4         3\n 4 Caroline, Edna         15     0.3         4\n 5 Esther, Henry          17     0.34        5\n 6 Maeve, Josh            18     0.36        6\n 7 Ace, Chris             18     0.36        7\n 8 Maddie, Brent          19     0.38        8\n 9 Damani, Melissa        15     0.3         9\n10 Dohyun, Estel          18     0.36       10\n# ℹ 23 more rows\n\n\nFor each group, we are given their names, the number of red_beads they obtained, and the corresponding proportion out of 50 beads that were red, called prop_red. We also have a group_ID variable which gives each of the 33 groups a unique identifier. Each row can be viewed as one instance of a replicated activity: using the shovel to remove 50 beads and computing the proportion of those beads that were red.\nLet’s visualize the distribution of these 33 proportions using geom_histogram() with binwidth = 0.05. This is a computerized and complete version of the partially completed hand-drawn histogram you saw earlier.\n\nShow the codetactile_sample_urn |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  \n  # Setting `boundary = 0.4` indicates that we want a binning scheme such that\n  # one of the bins' boundary is at 0.4. `color = \"white\"` modifies the color of\n  # the boundary for visual clarity.\n  \n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, \n                 boundary = 0.4, \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  \n  # Add scale_y_continuous with breaks by 1, as the default shows the y-axis\n  # from 1 to 10 with breaks at .5.

We want to know the proportion of red beads in the urn, with the urn being our population. Performing an exhaustive count of the red and white beads would be too time consuming. Therefore, it is much more practical to extract a sample of 50 beads using the shovel. Using this sample of 50 beads, we estimated the proportion of the urn’s beads that are red to be about 34%.\nMoreover, because we mixed the beads before each use of the shovel, the samples were random and independent. Because each sample was drawn at random, the samples were different from each other. This is an example of sampling variation. For example, what if instead of selecting 17 beads in our first sample we had selected just 11? Does that mean that the population proportion of the beads is 11/50 or 22%? No! Because we performed 33 trials we can look to our histogram, and see that the peak of the distribution occurs when \\(.35 &lt; \\hat{\\rho} &lt; .4\\) , so it is likely that the proportion of red beads in the entire population will also fall in or near this range.",

    "text": "3.2 Virtual sampling\nWe just performed a tactile sampling activity. We used a physical urn of beads and a physical shovel. We did this by hand so that we could develop our intuition about the ideas behind sampling. In this section, we mimic this physical sampling with virtual sampling, using a computer.\n\n3.2.1 Using the virtual shovel once\nVirtual sampling requires a virtual urn and a virtual shovel. Create a tibble named urn. The rows of urn correspond exactly to the contents of the actual urn.\n\nShow the code# set.seed() ensures that the beads in our virtual urn are always in the same\n# order. This ensures that the figures in the book match their written\n# descriptions. We want 40% of the beads to be red.\n\nset.seed(8)\n\nurn &lt;- tibble(color = c(rep(\"red\", 400), \n                        rep(\"white\", 600))) |&gt;\n  \n  # sample_frac() keeps all the rows in the tibble but rearranges their order.\n  # We don't need to do this. A virtual urn does not care about the order of the\n  # beads. But we find it aesthetically pleasing to mix them up.\n  \n  sample_frac() |&gt; \n  mutate(bead_ID = 1:1000) |&gt; \n  select(bead_ID, color)\n\nurn  \n\n# A tibble: 1,000 × 2\n   bead_ID color\n     &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n 1       1 white\n 2       2 red  \n 3       3 red  \n 4       4 white\n 5       5 white\n 6       6 red  \n 7       7 white\n 8       8 white\n 9       9 red  \n10      10 red  \n# ℹ 990 more rows\n\n\nObserve that urn has 1,000 rows, meaning that the urn contains 1,000 beads. The first variable bead_ID is used as an identification variable. None of the beads in the actual urn are marked with numbers. The second variable color indicates whether a particular virtual bead is red or white.\nOur virtual urn needs a virtual shovel. We use slice_sample() and some list-column mapping wizardry to take a sample of 50 beads from our virtual urn.\n\nShow the code# Define trial_ID as one instance of us sampling 50 beads from the urn. When\n# trial_ID is called within map(), we are performing slice_sample() upon our urn\n# once, and taking a sample of 50 beads. \n\ntibble(trial_ID = 1) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50)))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  trial_ID shovel           \n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;           \n1        1 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;\n\n\nAs usual, map functions and list-columns are powerful but confusing. The str() function is a good way to explore a tibble with a list-column.\n\nShow the codetibble(trial_ID = 1) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) |&gt; \n  str()\n\ntibble [1 × 2] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ trial_ID: num 1\n $ shovel  :List of 1\n  ..$ : tibble [50 × 2] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n  .. ..$ bead_ID: int [1:50] 391 171 24 703 399 404 134 145 272 487 ...\n  .. ..$ color  : chr [1:50] \"white\" \"white\" \"white\" \"white\" ...\n\n\nThere are two levels. There is one row in the tibble for each sample. So far, we have only drawn one sample. Within each row, there is a second level, the tibble which is the sample. That tibble has two variables: trial_ID and color. This is the advantage to using slice_sample(), because it selects all columns of our urn, whereas sample() can only sample from a single column. While identifying each individual bead may be irrelevant in our urn scenario, with other problems it could be very useful to have additional data about each individual.\nNow let’s add a column which indicates the number of red beads in the sample taken from the shovel.\n\n\nShow the codetibble(trial_ID = 1) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) |&gt; \n  \n  # To count the number of red beads in each shovel, we can use a lesser \n  # known property of the sum() function: By passing in a comparison \n  # expression, sum() will count the number of occurrences within a vector. \n  # In this case, we count the total number occurrences of the word red\n  # in the color column of shovel.\n\n  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\")))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 3\n  trial_ID shovel            numb_red\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;               &lt;int&gt;\n1        1 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       17\n\n\nHow does this work? R evaluates if color == red, and treats TRUE values like the number 1 and FALSE values like the number 0. So summing the number of TRUEs and FALSEs is equivalent to summing 1’s and 0’s. In the end, this operation counts the number of beads where color equals “red”.\nFinally, calculate the proportion red by dividing numb_red (the number of red beads observed in the shovel) by the shovel size (which is 50 in this example).\n\nShow the codetibble(trial_ID = 1) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) |&gt; \n  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 50)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  trial_ID shovel            numb_red prop_red\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;               &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        1 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       17     0.34\n\n\nCareful readers will note that the numb_red is changing in each example above. The reason, of course, is that each block re-runs the shovel exercise, and slice_sample() will return a random number of red beads. If we wanted the same number in each block, we would need to use the set.seed() function and then set the same seed each time.\nLet’s now perform the virtual analog of having 33 groups of students use the sampling shovel.\n\n3.2.2 Using the virtual shovel 33 times\nIn our tactile sampling exercise in Section 3.1, we had 33 groups of students use the shovel, yielding 33 samples of size 50 beads. We then used these 33 samples to compute 33 proportions.\nLet’s use our virtual sampling to replicate the tactile sampling activity in a virtual format. We’ll save these results in a data frame called virtual_samples.\n\nShow the codeset.seed(13)\n\n virtual_samples &lt;- tibble(trial_ID = 1:33) |&gt;\n    mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) |&gt; \n    mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt;\n    mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 50) \n\nvirtual_samples\n\n# A tibble: 33 × 4\n   trial_ID shovel            numb_red prop_red\n      &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&gt;               &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1        1 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       21     0.42\n 2        2 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       21     0.42\n 3        3 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       20     0.4 \n 4        4 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       17     0.34\n 5        5 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       20     0.4 \n 6        6 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       18     0.36\n 7        7 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       24     0.48\n 8        8 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       21     0.42\n 9        9 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       17     0.34\n10       10 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       21     0.42\n# ℹ 23 more rows\n\n\nLet’s visualize this variation in a histogram:\n\nShow the codevirtual_samples |&gt; \nggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, \n                 boundary = 0.4, \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  \n  # To use mathematical symbols in titles and labels, use the expression()\n  # function, as here.\n  \n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"Proportion, \", hat(rho), \", of 50 beads that were red\")),\n       y = \"Count\",\n       title = \"Distribution of 33 proportions red\") +\n  \n  # Label the y-axis in an attractive fashion. Without this code, the axis\n  # labels would include 2.5, which makes no sense because all the values are\n  # integers.\n  \n  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(2, 10, 2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince binwidth = 0.05, this will create bins with boundaries at 0.30, 0.35, 0.45, and so on. Recall that \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) is equal to the proportion of beads which are red in each sample.\nObserve that we occasionally obtained proportions red that are less than 30%. On the other hand, we occasionally obtained proportions that are greater than 45%. However, the most frequently occurring proportions were between 35% and 45%. Why do we have these differences in proportions red? Because of sampling variation.\nNow we will compare our virtual results with our tactile results from the previous section. Observe that both histograms are somewhat similar in their center and variation, although not identical. These slight differences are again due to random sampling variation. Furthermore, observe that both distributions are somewhat bell-shaped.\n\n\n\n\nComparing 33 virtual and 33 tactile proportions red. Note that, though the figures differ slightly, both are centered around .35 to .45. This shows that, in both sampling distributions, the most frequently occuring proportion red is between 35% and 45%.\n\n\n\nThis visualization allows us to see how our results differed between our tactile and virtual urn results. As we can see, there is some variation between our results. This is not a cause for concern, as there is always sampling variation across results.\n\n3.2.3 Using the virtual shovel 10,000 times\n\n\n\n\nSo much sampling, so little time.\n\n\n\nAlthough we took 33 samples from the urn in the previous section, we should not use so few samples. Instead, in this section we’ll examine the effects of sampling from the urn 10,000 times.\nWe can reuse our code from above, making sure to replace 33 trials with 10,000.\n\nShow the codeset.seed(9)\n\n virtual_samples &lt;- tibble(trial_ID = 1:10000) |&gt;\n    mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) |&gt; \n    mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt;\n    mutate(numb_beads = map_int(shovel, ~ length(.$color))) |&gt; \n    mutate(prop_red = numb_red / numb_beads) \n\n\nNow we have 10,000 values for prop_red, each representing the proportion of 50 beads that are red in a sample. Using the same code as earlier, let’s visualize the distribution of these 10,000 replicates of prop_red in a histogram:\n\nShow the codevirtual_samples |&gt; \nggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01, \n                 boundary = 0.4, \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = expression(hat(rho)),\n       y = \"Count\",\n       title = \"Distribution of 10,000 proportions red\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy the empty spaces among the bars? Recall that, with only 50 beads, there are only 51 possible values for \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\): 0, 0.02, 0.04, …, 0.98, 1. A value of 0.31 or 0.47 is impossible, hence the gaps.\nThe most frequently occurring proportions of red beads occur, again, between 35% and 45%. Every now and then we observe proportions much higher or lower. This occurs because as we increase the number of trials, tails develop on our distribution as we are more likely to witness extreme \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) values. The symmetric, bell-shaped distribution shown in the histogram is well approximated by the normal distribution.\nNow that we have a good understanding of virtual sampling, we can apply our knowledge to examine the effects of changing our virtual shovel size.\n\n3.2.4 The effect of different shovel sizes\n\n\n\n\nWhat happens if we use different sized shovels to sample?\n\n\n\nInstead of just one shovel, imagine we have three choices of shovels with which to extract a sample of beads: shovels of size 25, 50, and 100. Using our newly developed tools for virtual sampling, let’s unpack the effect of having different sample sizes. Start by creating a tibble with 10,000 rows, each row representing an instance of us sampling from the urn with our chosen shovel size. Then, compute the resulting 10,000 replicates of proportion red. Finally, plot the distribution using a histogram.\n\nShow the code# Within slice_sample(), n = 25 represents our shovel of size 25. We also divide\n# by 25 to compute the proportion red.\n\nvirtual_samples_25 &lt;- tibble(trial_ID = 1:10000) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 25))) |&gt; \n  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 25)\n\nvirtual_samples_25 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, \n                 boundary = 0.4, \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"Proportion, \", hat(rho), \", of 25 beads that were red\")), \n       title = \"25\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will repeat this process with a shovel size of 50.\n\nShow the codevirtual_samples_50 &lt;- tibble(trial_ID = 1:10000) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 50))) |&gt; \n  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 50)\n\n\nvirtual_samples_50  |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, \n                 boundary = 0.4, \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"Proportion, \", hat(rho), \", of 50 beads that were red\")), \n       title = \"50\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe choose a bin width of .04 for all histograms to more easily compare different shovel sizes. Using a smaller bin size would result in gaps between the bars, as a shovel of size 50 has more possible \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) values than a shovel of size 25.\nFinally, we will perform the same process with 10,000 replicates to map the histogram using a shovel size of 100.\n\nShow the codevirtual_samples_100 &lt;- tibble(trial_ID = 1:10000) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(trial_ID, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = 100))) |&gt; \n  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / 100)\n\n\nvirtual_samples_100 |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, \n                 boundary = 0.4, \n                 color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"Proportion, \", hat(rho), \", of 100 beads that were red\")), \n       title = \"100\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor easy comparison, we present the three resulting histograms in a single row with matching x and y axes:\n\nShow the code# Use bind_rows to combine the data from our three saved virtual sampling\n# objects. Use mutate() in each to clarify the n as the necessary number\n# of samples taken. This makes our data easier to interpret and prevents\n# duplicate elements.\n\nvirtual_prop &lt;- bind_rows(virtual_samples_25 |&gt; \n                            mutate(n = 25), \n                          virtual_samples_50 |&gt; \n                            mutate(n = 50), \n                          virtual_samples_100 |&gt; \n                            mutate(n = 100))\n\n# Plot our new object with the x-axis showing prop_red. Add elements binwidth,\n# boundary, and color for stylistic clarity. Use labs() to add an x-axis label\n# and title. Facet_wrap() splits the graph into multiple plots by the variable\n# (~n).\n\ncomparing_sampling_distributions &lt;- ggplot(virtual_prop, aes(x = prop_red)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.04, boundary = 0.4, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(x = expression(paste(\"Proportion, \", hat(rho), \", of the beads that were red\")), \n       title = \"Comparing distributions of proportions red for three different shovel sizes.\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ n) \n\n# Inspect our new faceted graph. \n\ncomparing_sampling_distributions\n\n\n\nComparing the distributions of proportion red for different sample sizes (25, 50, 100). The important takeaway is that our center becomes more concentrated as our sample size increases, indicating a smaller standard deviation between our guesses.\n\n\n\nObserve that as the sample size increases, the histogram becomes taller and narrower. This is because the variation of the proportion red for each sample decreases. Remember: A large variation means there are a wide range of values that might occur, while smaller variations are more concentrated around the central value.\nThe Central Limit Theorem states, more or less, that when sample means are based on larger and larger sample sizes, the sampling distribution of these sample means becomes both narrower and more bell-shaped. In other words, the sampling distribution increasingly follows a normal distribution and the variation of this sampling distribution gets smaller.\nWhy does variation decrease as sample size increases? If we use a large sample size like 100 or 500, our sample is much more representative of the population. As a result, the proportion red in our sample (\\(\\hat{\\rho}\\)) will be closer to the true population proportion (\\(\\rho\\)). On the other hand, smaller samples have much more variation because of chance. We are much more likely to have extreme estimates that are not representative of our population when the sample size is small.\nLet’s attempt to visualize the concept of variation a different way. For each sample size, let’s plot the proportion red for all 10,000 samples. With 3 different shovel sizes, we will have 30,000 total points, with each point representing an instance of sampling from the urn with a specific shovel size.\n\nShow the codevirtual_prop |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = n, y = prop_red, color = as.factor(n))) +\n  geom_jitter(alpha = .15) + \n  labs(title = \"Results of 10,000 samples for 3 different shovel sizes.\",\n       subtitle = \"As shovel size increases, variation decreases.\",\n       y = \"Proportion red in sample\",\n       color = \"Shovel size\") +\n  \n  # We do not need an x axis, because the color of the points denotes the shovel size. \n   \n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.ticks.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph illustrates the exact same concept as the histogram. With the smallest shovel size, there is significant variance from sample to sample, as samples feature, by chance, some extreme results. However, as we increase the sample size, the points become more concentrated, i.e., they demonstrate less variance.\nThere is also a third way to understand variation. We can be numerically explicit about the amount of variation in our three sets of 10,000 values of prop_red by using the standard deviation. A standard deviation is a summary statistic that measures the amount of variation within a numeric vector. For all three sample sizes, let’s compute the standard deviation of the 10,000 proportions red.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing standard deviations of proportions red for three different shovels\n\n\nNumber of slots in shovel\nStandard deviation of proportions red\n\n\n\n\n25\n0.098\n\n\n50\n0.068\n\n\n100\n0.046\n\n\n\n\nComparing the number of slots in the shovel with the standard deviation of proportions red. Here, we see that standard deviation decreases with higher sample sizes. Larger sample sizes yield more precise estimates.\n\n\n \nAs the sample size increases, the sample-to-sample variation decreases, and our guesses at the true proportion of the urn’s beads that are red get more precise. The larger the shovel, the more precise the result.\n\n\n\n\nVariance appears everywhere in data science.\n\n\n\nLet’s take a step back from all the variance. The reality is that our code needs to be better optimized, as it is bad practice to make a separate tibble for each sample size. To make comparisons easier, let’s attempt to put all 3 shovel sizes in the same tibble using mapping.\n\nShow the codetibble(trial_ID = 1:10000) |&gt;\n  mutate(shovel_ID = map(trial_ID, ~c(25, 50, 100))) |&gt;\n  unnest(shovel_ID) |&gt;\n  mutate(samples = map(shovel_ID, ~slice_sample(urn, n = .))) |&gt;\n  mutate(num_red = map_int(samples, ~sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt;\n  mutate(prop_red = num_red/shovel_ID)\n\n# A tibble: 30,000 × 5\n   trial_ID shovel_ID samples            num_red prop_red\n      &lt;int&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;               &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1        1        25 &lt;tibble [25 × 2]&gt;       13     0.52\n 2        1        50 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       27     0.54\n 3        1       100 &lt;tibble [100 × 2]&gt;      49     0.49\n 4        2        25 &lt;tibble [25 × 2]&gt;       12     0.48\n 5        2        50 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       22     0.44\n 6        2       100 &lt;tibble [100 × 2]&gt;      33     0.33\n 7        3        25 &lt;tibble [25 × 2]&gt;       11     0.44\n 8        3        50 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;       16     0.32\n 9        3       100 &lt;tibble [100 × 2]&gt;      33     0.33\n10        4        25 &lt;tibble [25 × 2]&gt;       13     0.52\n# ℹ 29,990 more rows\n\n\nTo those of us who do not completely understand mapping, do not fret! The tidyr package provides the expand_grid() function as a neat alternative. We can use expand_grid() and a new variable, shovel_size, to create a tibble which will organize our results. Instead of using 1,000 trials, let’s use 3 to get a feel for the function.\n\nShow the codeexpand_grid(trial_ID = c(1:3), shovel_size = c(25, 50, 100))\n\n# A tibble: 9 × 2\n  trial_ID shovel_size\n     &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        1          25\n2        1          50\n3        1         100\n4        2          25\n5        2          50\n6        2         100\n7        3          25\n8        3          50\n9        3         100\n\n\nThe above sets the stage for simulating three samples for each of three different shovel sizes. Similar code as above can be used.\n\nShow the codeexpand_grid(trial_ID = c(1:3), shovel_size = c(25, 50, 100)) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(shovel_size, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = .))) |&gt; \n  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_red = numb_red/shovel_size) \n\n# A tibble: 9 × 5\n  trial_ID shovel_size shovel             numb_red prop_red\n     &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt;                &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1        1          25 &lt;tibble [25 × 2]&gt;         9     0.36\n2        1          50 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;        20     0.4 \n3        1         100 &lt;tibble [100 × 2]&gt;       46     0.46\n4        2          25 &lt;tibble [25 × 2]&gt;         7     0.28\n5        2          50 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;        12     0.24\n6        2         100 &lt;tibble [100 × 2]&gt;       35     0.35\n7        3          25 &lt;tibble [25 × 2]&gt;        14     0.56\n8        3          50 &lt;tibble [50 × 2]&gt;        16     0.32\n9        3         100 &lt;tibble [100 × 2]&gt;       34     0.34\n\n\nAgain, we changed the second line to use shovel_size rather than trial_ID as the mapping variable since we can no longer hard code the shovel size into the call to slice_sample(). Expand to 1,000 simulations for each value of shovel_size and finish with a calculation of standard deviation.\n\nShow the codeexpand_grid(trial_ID = c(1:10000), shovel_size = c(25, 50, 100)) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(shovel_size, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = .))) |&gt; \n  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_red = numb_red/shovel_size) |&gt;\n  summarize(st_dev_p_hat = sd(prop_red),\n            .by = shovel_size)\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 2\n  shovel_size st_dev_p_hat\n        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1          25       0.0964\n2          50       0.0675\n3         100       0.0465\n\n\nThis is, approximately, the same result as we saw above, but with one re-factored tibble instead of three separate ones. Use functions like expand_grid() in the future to make your code more concise.\nNow that we have this framework, there’s no need to limit ourselves to the sizes 25, 50, and 100. Why not try all integers from 1 to 100? We can use the same code, except we’ll now set shovel_size = 1:100. (We also decrease the number of replications from 10,000 to 1,000 in order to save time.)\n\nShow the codeshovels_100 &lt;- expand_grid(trial_ID = c(1:1000), shovel_size = c(1:100)) |&gt; \n  mutate(shovel = map(shovel_size, ~ slice_sample(urn, n = .))) |&gt; \n  mutate(numb_red = map_int(shovel, ~ sum(.$color == \"red\"))) |&gt; \n  mutate(prop_red = numb_red / shovel_size) |&gt; \n  summarize(st_dev_p_hat = sd(prop_red),\n            .by = shovel_size)\n\nglimpse(shovels_100)\n\nRows: 100\nColumns: 2\n$ shovel_size  &lt;int&gt; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17…\n$ st_dev_p_hat &lt;dbl&gt; 0.49207941, 0.33817764, 0.27815410, 0.24720459, 0.2187414…\n\n\nNow, we have the standard deviation of prop_red for all shovel sizes from 1 to 100. Let’s plot that value to see how it changes as the shovel gets larger:\n\n\n\n\nComparing standard deviations of proportions red for 100 different shovels. The standard deviation decreases at the same rate as the square root of shovel size. The red line shows the standard error.\n\n\n\nThe red line here represents an important statistical concept: standard error (SE). As the shovel size increases, and thus our sample size increases, we find that the standard error decreases.\n\n\n\n\nTo any poets and philosophers confused about this: don’t worry! It won’t be on a problem set.\n\n\n\nThis is the power of running many analyses at once using map functions and list columns: before, we could tell that the standard deviation was decreasing as the shovel size increased, but when only looking at shovel sizes of 25, 50, and 100, it wasn’t clear how quickly it was decreasing.",

    "text": "3.3 Standard error\n\n\n\n\nStandard errors are just the way old people talk about confidence intervals.\n\n\n\nStandard errors (SE) quantify the effect of sampling variation on our estimates. In other words, they quantify how much we can expect the calculated proportions of a shovel’s beads that are red to vary from one sample to another sample to another sample. As sample size increases, the standard error decreases.\nThe standard error is the standard deviation of a sample statistic such as the estimated proportion. For example, the standard error of the mean refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means taken from a population.\nThe relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is that, for a given sample size, the standard error equals the standard deviation of the data divided by the square root of the sample size. Accordingly, the standard error is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size. The larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error.\n\n3.3.1 Terminology and notation\n\n\n\n\nLet Yoda’s wisdom dull the pain of this terminology section.\n\n\n\nA population is the set of relevant units. The population’s size is upper-case \\(N\\). In our sampling activities, the population is the collection of \\(N\\) = 1,000 identically-sized red and white beads in the urn. This is about the simplest possible population. Other examples are all the adult men in the US, all the classrooms in a school, all the wheelbarrows in Massachusetts, all the values of your blood pressure, read at five minute intervals, for your entire life. Often, the population extends over time, as with your blood pressure readings and is, therefore, more amorphous. Consider all the people who have run for governor of a US state since 1900, or all the people who will run for governor through 2050. Those are also populations.\nA population parameter is a numeric statistic about the population that is unknown, but you wish you knew. For example, when this quantity is the mean, the population parameter of interest is the population mean. This is mathematically denoted with the Greek letter \\(\\mu\\) pronounced “mu.” In our earlier sampling-from-the-urn activity, however, since we were interested in the proportion of the urn’s beads that were red, the population parameter is the population proportion of interest, denoted by \\(\\rho\\). Different academic fields often use different Greek letters to denote the same population parameter.\nA census is an exhaustive enumeration or counting of all \\(N\\) units in the population in order to compute the population parameter’s value exactly. In our sampling activity, this would correspond to counting the number of red beads out of the \\(N\\) total in the urn and then computing the red population proportion, \\(\\rho\\), exactly. When the number \\(N\\) of individuals or observations in our population is large as was the case with our urn, a census can be quite expensive in terms of time, energy, and money. A census is impossible for any population which includes the future, like our blood pressure next year or candidates for governor in 2050. There is a truth, but we could not, even in theory, determine it.\nSampling is the act of collecting a sample from the population when we can not, or do not want to, perform a census. The sample size is lower case \\(n\\), as opposed to upper case \\(N\\) for the population’s size. Typically the sample size \\(n\\) is much smaller than the population size \\(N\\). In our sampling activities, we used shovels with varying slots to extract samples of size \\(n = 1\\) through \\(n = 100\\).\nA point estimate, also known as a sample statistic, is a measure computed from a sample that estimates an unknown population parameter. In our sampling activities, recall that the unknown population parameter was the proportion of red beads and that this is denoted by \\(\\rho\\). Our point estimate is the sample proportion: the proportion of the shovel’s beads that are red. In other words, it is our guess at the proportion of the urn’s beads that are red. The point estimate of the parameter \\(\\rho\\) is \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\). The “hat” on top of the \\(\\rho\\) indicates that it is an estimate of the unknown population proportion \\(\\rho\\).\nA sample is said to be representative if it roughly looks like the population. In other words, are the sample’s characteristics a good representation of the population’s characteristics? In our sampling activity, are the samples of \\(n\\) beads extracted using our shovels representative of the urn’s \\(N = 1,000\\) beads?\nA sample is generalizable if any results based on the sample can generalize to the population. In our sampling activity, can we generalize the sample proportion from our shovels to the entire urn? Using our mathematical notation, this is akin to asking if \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) is a “good guess” of \\(\\rho\\).\nBiased sampling occurs if certain individuals or observations in a population have a higher chance of being included in a sample than others. We say a sampling procedure is unbiased if every observation in a population had an equal chance of being sampled. Had the red beads been much smaller than the white beads, and therefore more prone to falling out of the shovel, our sample would have been biased. In our sampling activities, since we mixed all \\(N = 1,000\\) beads prior to each group’s sampling and since each of the beads had an equal chance of being sampled, our samples were unbiased.\nA sampling procedure is random if we sample randomly from the population in an unbiased fashion. With random sampling, each unit has an equal chance of being selected into the sample. This condition entails, among other things, sufficiently mixing the urn before each use of the shovel.\n\n\n\n\nFear not if you look like Spongebob after reading this section. We will re-cap right now!\n\n\n\nIn general:\n\nIf the sampling of a sample of size \\(n\\) is done at random, then\nthe sample is unbiased and representative of the population of size \\(N\\), thus\nany result based on the sample can generalize to the population, thus\nthe point estimate is a “good guess” of the unknown population parameter, thus\ninstead of performing a census, we can draw inferences about the population using sampling.\n\nSpecific to our sampling activity:\n\nIf we extract a sample of \\(n=50\\) beads at random, in other words, we mix all of the equally-sized beads before using the shovel, then\nthe contents of the shovel are an unbiased representation of the contents of the urn’s 1,000 beads, thus\nany result based on the shovel’s beads can generalize to the urn, thus\nthe sample proportion \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) of the \\(n=50\\) beads in the shovel that are red is a “good guess” of the population proportion \\(\\rho\\) of the \\(N=1,000\\) beads that are red, thus\ninstead of manually going over all 1,000 beads in the urn, we can make inferences about the urn by using the results from the shovel.\n\n3.3.2 Statistical definitions\nFor our 1,000 repeated/replicated virtual samples of size \\(n = 25\\), \\(n = 50\\), and \\(n = 100\\) in Section 3.2, let’s display our figure showing the difference in proportions red according to different shovel sizes.\n\n\n\n\nPreviously seen three distributions of the sample proportion \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\).\n\n\n\nThese types of distributions have a special name: sampling distributions. The visualization displays the effect of sampling variation on the distribution of a point estimate: the sample proportion \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\). Using these sampling distributions, for a given sample size \\(n\\), we can make statements about what range of values we typically expect.\nFor example, observe the centers of all three sampling distributions: all around \\(0.4 = 40\\%\\). Furthermore, observe that while we are somewhat likely to observe sample proportions of red beads of \\(0.2 = 20\\%\\) when using the shovel with 25 slots, we will almost never observe a proportion of 20% when using the shovel with 100 slots. Observe also the effect of sample size on the sampling variation. As the sample size \\(n\\) increases from 25 to 50 to 100, the variation of the sampling distributions decreases and thus the values cluster more and more tightly around the same center: about 40%.\n\n\n\n\nPreviously seen comparing standard deviations of proportions red from 100 different shovel sizes\n\n\n\nAs the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the proportion of red beads across the 1,000 replications decreases. This type of standard deviation has another special name: standard error\n\n3.3.3 What is a standard error?\nThe standard error (SE) is the standard deviation of a sample statistic (aka point estimate), such as the mean or median. For example, the “standard error of the mean” refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means taken from a population.\n\nIn statistics, a sample mean deviates from the actual mean of a population; this deviation is the standard error of the mean.\n\nMany students struggle to differentiate the standard error from the standard deviation. The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is such that, for a given sample size, the standard error equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nLarger sample size = smaller standard error = more representative of the truth.\nTo help reinforce these concepts, let’s re-display our previous figure but using our new sampling terminology, notation, and definitions:\n\n\n\n\nThree sampling distributions of the sample proportion \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\). Note the increased concentration on the bins around .4 as our sample size increases.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, let’s display the graph of standard errors for \\(n = 1\\) to \\(n = 100\\) using our new terminology, notation, and definitions relating to sampling.\n\n\n\n\nStandard errors of the sample proportion based on sample sizes of 1 to 100\n\n\n\nAs the sample size \\(n\\) goes up, the “typical” error of your point estimate will go down, as quantified by the standard error.\n\n3.3.4 The moral of the story\nStandard error is just a fancy term for your uncertainty about something you don’t know. Standard error is the precision of our (uncertain) beliefs.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are wondering how much you need to know, follow this helpful guide of the information we have learned this chapter!\n\n\n\nThis hierarchy represents the knowledge we need to understand standard errors. At the bottom, we have math. It’s the foundation for our understanding, but it doesn’t need to be what we take away from this lesson. As we go up, we simplify the topic. The top of the pyramid are the most basic levels of understanding.\nIf I know your estimate plus or minus two standard errors, I know your 95% confidence interval. This is valuable information. Standard error is really just a measure for how uncertain we are about something we do not know, the thing we are estimating. Speaking snarkily, standard error is the way old people talk about confidence intervals.\nRecall that \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) is the estimated value of p which comes from taking a sample. There can be billions and billions of \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\)’s. We look at a large group of \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\)’s, create a distribution of results to represent the possible values of \\(\\rho\\) based on our findings, and then we compute a standard error to account for our own uncertainty about our estimates. Our 95% confidence interval for our prediction is our estimate plus or minus two standard errors.\nYou must understand what the standard error of \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) means. You do not need to understand why.\nCentral lesson: Your posterior for (almost) any population parameter is normally distributed with a mean equal to the sample mean and a standard deviation equal to the standard error. And that means that your posterior has the same shape as the sampling distribution.",

    "text": "3.4 Cardinal Virtues\nRecall that we began this chapter by asking about \\(\\rho\\), the proportion of red beads in the urn. Use the Cardinal Virtues to guide your thinking.\n\n3.4.1 Wisdom\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisdom requires the creation of a Preceptor Table, an examination of our data, and a determination, using the concept of validity, as to whether or not we can (reasonably!) assume that the two come from the same population.\n\n3.4.1.1 Preceptor Table\nA Preceptor Table is smallest possible table with rows and columns such that, if there is no missing data, our question is easy to answer.\nThe units are, obviously, the individual beads.\nThe outcome for each unit is its color. Note how the outcome is not the same as the answer to the question. The question concerns a summary measure for the urn as a whole. The outcome is always measured for each unit, which is an individual bead in this case.\nThe is a predictive model because there is only one outcome. We want to know what percentage of the beads would be red if we were to dump all the beads out of the urn and then count up the number of white and red beads.\nThere are no covariates because this is such a simple question. If there were some other measure, like size or texture, which allowed us to distinguish among beads, then we might use those as part of our model. But, in this case, the only thing which distinguishes beads is their color.\nThere is not a treatment because this is a predictive model.\nThe moment in time to which the Preceptor Table refers is now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\nColor\n\n\n\n\n1\nwhite\n\n\n2\nwhite\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n200\nred\n\n\n201\nwhite\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n2078\nred\n\n\n2079\nwhite\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNote that the beads do not have ID numbers printed on them. The numbering is arbitrary. Having an ID just reminds us that there are actual units under consideration, even if we can not tell them apart, other than by color. We also include the ID to help visualize the fact that we don’t know the total number of beads in the urn, because our question never tells us! There could be 1,000 beads like our physical urn from earlier, or there could be a million beads. The ellipses at the bottom of the Preceptor Table denotes our uncertainty regarding urn size.\nIf we knew the color of every bead, then calculating the proportion of beads which are red, \\(\\rho\\), is simple algebra. As always, a Preceptor Table is the smallest such table which would still allow us to answer our question.\n\n3.4.1.2 EDA\nThe data we have, unfortunately, only provides the color for 50 beads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData from Shovel\n\n\nID\nColor\n\n\n\n\n2\nwhite\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n200\nred\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n2079\nwhite\n\n\n3042\nwhite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nThe data table has exactly 50 rows. Again, there are, in truth, no ID numbers. But keeping track of which beads were in the sample and which beads were not can be helpful.\n\n3.4.1.3 Validity\nThe last step of Wisdom is to decide whether or not we can consider the units from the Preceptor Table and the units from the data to have been drawn from the same population. In this case, as with many sampling scenarios, it is trivial that we may make this assumption. If all the rows from the data are also rows in the Preceptor Table, we may assume that they are drawn from the same distribution.\nValidity involves the columns of our data set. Is the meaning of our columns consistent across the different data sources? In our urn scenario, does bead color in our sampled data and bead color in our Preceptor Table mean the same thing? The answer is “Yes.” Validity can be assumed very easily.\nWe end Wisdom by summarizing our data and our question.\n\nUsing a sample of 50 beads drawn from an urn in which all beads are either red or white, we seek to determine the proportion of beads which are red.\n\n\n3.4.2 Justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice concerns four topics: the Population Table, stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness.\n\n3.4.2.1 Population Table\nWe use The Population Table to acknowledge the wider source from which we could have collected our data.\nIt includes rows from three sources: the data for units we want to have (the Preceptor Table), the data for units which we have (our actual data), and the data for units we do not care about (the rest of the population, not included in the data or the Preceptor Table).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nLocation\nTime\nID\nColor\n\n\n\n…\nKnown, specific urn\nTime of sample - 2 years\n1\n?\n\n\n…\nKnown, specific urn\nTime of sample - 2 years\n200\n?\n\n\n…\nKnown, specific urn\nTime of sample - 2 years\n976\n?\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nData\nKnown, specific urn\nTime of sample\n2\nwhite\n\n\nData\nKnown, specific urn\nTime of sample\n200\nred\n\n\nData\nKnown, specific urn\nTime of sample\n1080\nwhite\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n…\nKnown, specific urn\nTime of sample + 3 weeks\n1\n?\n\n\n…\nKnown, specific urn\nTime of sample + 3 weeks\n200\n?\n\n\n…\nKnown, specific urn\nTime of sample + 3 weeks\n2025\n?\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nPreceptor Table\nKnown, specific urn\nNow\n1\n?\n\n\nPreceptor Table\nKnown, specific urn\nNow\n200\nred\n\n\nPreceptor Table\nKnown, specific urn\nNow\n2078\n?\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n…\nKnown, specific urn\nNow + 10 days\n1\n?\n\n\n…\nKnown, specific urn\nNow + 10 days\n200\n?\n\n\n…\nKnown, specific urn\nNow + 10 days\n2300\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEach specific row represents one subject, which are individual beads in our urn. Because there could be thousands or even millions of beads, we provide 3 examples for each category, and use ellipses to denote that there are many more subjects that we have yet to record.\nEach Population Table will usually have several types of columns: id, time, covariates, and outcome(s):\n\nBecause we draw our sample from the exact same urn our question asks us about, the data we collect comes directly from the Preceptor Table, all subjects in our population have the same location (“Known, specific urn”). The Preceptor Table and Population categories are essentially identical. This is the perfect scenario for us, but this rarely occurs in real life.\n\nPopulation Tables always have a column for Time. When answering a question, we must specify the moment in time to which it applies, because stuff happens and things change.\nWe must acknowledge that the sample from the urn could have been taken at any time, so the contents of the urn in the past (our data) could be different from the contents of the urn when we want to answer our question now (the Preceptor Table). As such, there is a wider population we could have collected our data from: anytime before collecting the sample, or anytime after collecting it.\n\n3.4.2.2 Stability\nStability means that the relationship between the columns in the Population Table is the same for three categories of rows: the data, the Preceptor Table, and the larger population from which both are drawn.\nStability involves time. Is the model — meaning both the mathematical formula and the value of the parameters — stable over time? Realistically, an urn will be the same today, tomorrow or next year. However, what if someone dumps some red beads into the urn after we take our sample? Then we cannot assume stability, because the proportion of red beads in the urn, \\(\\rho\\), the instant before the dump is different than the proportion red in the urn after. We will assume no one is tampering with our urn, and assume stability across time periods.\n\n3.4.2.3 Representativeness\nRepresentativeness, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationships among the rows in the Population Table. The first is between the Preceptor Table and the other rows. The second is between our data and the other rows. Ideally, we would like both the Preceptor Table and our data to be random samples from the population. Sadly, this is almost never the case.\nThe sampling mechanism is the technical term for the process by which some beads were sampled and some were not. We hope that all members of the population have the same chance of being sampled, or else our data might be unrepresentative of the larger population. Another term for this would be having a “biased” sample. Almost all samples have some bias, but we must make a judgement call to see if the data we have is close enough to the data we want (i.e., the Preceptor Table) that we can consider both as coming from the same population. Our sample of 50 beads is taken from a mixed urn, so hopefully there is a near equal chance of selecting each bead, and our samples are representative of the population.\n\n3.4.2.4 Unconfoundedness\nUnconfoundedness means that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes, when we condition on pre-treatment covariates. This assumption is only relevant for causal models. We describe a model as “confounded” if this is not true. The easiest way to ensure unconfoundedness is to assign treatment randomly.\nSince this is a predictive model, we do not have to worry about unconfoundedness. There is no “treatment” which might be confounded with anything.\nWe conclude Justice by adding one sentence about potential problems in our approach to our summary paragraph.\n\nUsing a sample of 50 beads drawn from an urn in which all beads are either red or white, we seek to determine the proportion of beads which are red. Our estimate would be flawed if someone has changed the beads in the urn since we drew our sample.\n\n\n3.4.3 Courage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourage begins with the exploration and testing of different models. It concludes with the creation of a Data Generating Mechanism.\n\n3.4.3.1 Models\nThe joint distribution, \\(p(y | \\theta)\\), models the outcome \\(y\\) given one or more unknown parameter(s), \\(\\theta\\). The equation illustrates the exact same concept we addressed while discussing the distinctions of Bayesian science: because our parameters are variable, we have to create separate distributions for each potential value.\nThe posterior, \\(p(\\theta | y)\\), is the probability distribution of our parameter(s) \\(\\theta\\), created using data \\(y\\).\nIn our urn scenario, obtaining the posterior involves first creating many binomial distributions for each possible population proportion. This is the joint distribution, and it is a 3 dimensional model. We then select the distribution that corresponds with our data: 17 red beads are sampled. We can represent the posterior with the following:\n\\[\\text{Prob}(\\text{models} | \\text{data} = 17)\\]\nThis is equivalent to taking a 2 dimensional slice of the 3 dimensional model. We are left with a probability distribution for our parameter, \\(\\rho\\).\nIn this chapter, we will neither calculate that posterior “by hand,” as we did in Chapter 2. Nor will we use an R package to do so, as in Chapter 4. Instead, we will create a rough posterior using simple calculations with our data.\nFirst, the percentage of red beads in the sample, \\(17/50 = 0.34\\), is a good estimate for the center of the posterior. Throughout this section, we are leaving formalism behind. We have not proved that the sample provides a good estimate of the center of the posterior but common sense suggests that it does.\nSecond, calculate the standard error:\n\\[  SE = \\frac{\\sigma\\text{ of data}}{\\sqrt{\\text{sample size}}} = \\frac{.4785}{\\sqrt{50}} \\approx .067\\]\nThe \\(\\sigma\\) of the data might seem to be a strange concept. What data do we have, besides 17 red beads and 33 white beads? The answer is that this is the data, and it is most sensibily represented as a vector of length 50, with 17 1’s and 33 0’s. The standard deviation of sd(c(rep(0, 17), rep(1, 33))) is 0.4785181.\nYou can then use the standard error to create a 95% confidence interval:\n\\[  CI = \\bar{x} \\hspace{.1cm} \\pm 2SE = .34 \\hspace{.1cm} \\pm .134\\]\nWith 95% confidence, the proportion of red beads in the urn is between 21% and 47%.\n\n\n3.4.3.2 Tests\nStatisticians also use hypothesis tests to quickly try to answer questions. Our view on hypothesis tests is that:\nAmateurs test. Professionals summarize.\nTraditionally, most scientific papers are not so much interested in estimating \\(\\rho\\). They are interested in testing specific hypotheses. What do we mean by that?\nLet’s look at a possible hypothesis in our urn paradigm: there are equal number of red and white beads in the urn. The null hypothesis, denoted by \\(H_0\\), is the theory we are testing, while the alternative hypothesis, denoted by \\(H_a\\), represents the opposite of our theory. Therefore, our hypothesis is designed as such:\n\\(H_0\\): There are an equal number of red and white beads in the urn.\n\\(H_a\\): There are not an equal number of red and white beads in the urn.\nCan we reject that hypothesis? Convention: if the 95% confidence interval excludes the null hypothesis, then we reject it. Here, that would mean if our estimate (plus or minus 2 standard errors) excluded the possibility of the red and white beads being equal (\\(\\rho = .5\\)) we can reject the null hypothesis. In the previous section we determined that the 95% confidence interval is between 21% and 47%. Because 50% is outside of this interval, we could reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that it is unlikely that the proportion of beads in the urn is 50%.\nIf we were testing the theory that \\(\\rho = .45\\) instead, our null hypothesis would fall within the confidence interval. This does not mean that we accept the null hypothesis. Instead, we simply don’t reject it. In our scenario we only know that there is some possibility that \\(\\rho = .45\\). We’re just back where we started! This is why we never test — unless your boss demands a test. Use your judgment, make your models, summarize your knowledge of the world, and use that summary to make decisions.\n\n3.4.3.3 Data generating mechanism\nThe data generating mechanism, or DGM, is a mathematical formula which mimics the process by which the data comes to us. The DGM for sampling scenarios with only two possible values is called Bernoulli and is often denoted as:\n\\[ red_i  \\sim Bernoulli(\\rho) \\]\nEach bead \\(i\\) which we sample can be either red or white. It is convenient to define the model in terms of whether or not the bead was red. If bead \\(i\\) is red, the value drawn is 1, which is the standard way of representing TRUE. In other words, \\(red_i = 1\\) means that bead \\(i\\) was red. Similarly, a white bead is indicated with 0, meaning that it is FALSE that the bead was red. \\(\\rho\\) is the only parameter in a Bernoulli model. It is the probability that a 1, instead of a 0, is drawn. That is, \\(\\rho\\) is the probability of a red bead.\nUsing our rough calculations above, we conclude that our posterior for \\(\\rho\\) is \\(N(0.34, 0.067)\\). So, our full data generating mechanism is:\n\\[ red_i  \\sim Bernoulli(\\rho) \\text{with} \\rho \\sim N(0.34, 0.067)\\] We conclude Courage by adding a sentence about our DGM to the summary paragraph.\n\nUsing a sample of 50 beads drawn from an urn in which all beads are either red or white, we seek to determine the proportion of beads which are red. Our estimate would be flawed if someone has changed the beads in the urn since we drew our sample. We model the color of an individual bead as a draw from a Bernoulli distribution with unknown parameter \\(\\rho\\).\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Temperance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperance uses the Data Generating Mechanism to answer the specific question with which we began. Humility reminds us that this answer is always a lie.\n\n3.4.4.1 Questions and Answers\nKnowing that the standard error is the standard deviation of the posterior (and that the posterior is approximately normal) allows us to create a graphic.\n\nShow the codetibble(obs = rnorm(1000000, mean = 0.34, sd = 0.067)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = obs)) +\n    geom_density(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))))  +\n    labs(title = expression(paste(\"Posterior Distribution for  \", rho)),\n         subtitle = \"There is a 95% chance for a value between 21% and 47%.\",\n         x = expression(paste(\"Proportion, \", rho, \", of Red Beads in Urn\")),\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is not precisely accurate. The full machinery of a proper Bayesian analysis would generate a (very) slightly different answer. To get that correct answer, we could either do everything by hand, as in Chapter 2, or use an R package, as in Chapter 4. However, the purpose of this chapter is to develop your intuition. Generating a 95% confidence interval using two times the standard error along with a normality assumption is good enough.\n\nWe conclude Temperance by adding a sentence which answers our question:\n\nUsing a sample of 50 beads drawn from an urn in which all beads are either red or white, we seek to determine the proportion of beads which are red. Our estimate would be flawed if someone has changed the beads in the urn since we drew our sample. We model the color of an individual bead as a draw from a Bernoulli distribution with unknown parameter \\(\\rho\\). The percentage of red beads in the urn is about 34%, with a 95% credible interval from 21% to 47%.\n\n\n3.4.4.2 Humility\nWe can never know the truth.\nThere is a truth! There is a true value for \\(\\rho\\) which we do not know. We want to create a posterior probability distribution which summarizes our knowledge. We care about the posterior probability distribution of \\(\\rho\\). The center of that distribution is around the mean or median of the proportion in your sample. The standard deviation of that posterior is the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of our sample size. Note that this is the same thing as the standard deviation of the repeated samples.\nWe journey from reality, to our predictions, to the standard error of our predictions, to the posterior probability distribution for \\(\\rho\\). This is our sequence:\n\\(\\rho\\) (i.e., the truth) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) (i.e., my estimate) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) the standard error of \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) (i.e., black box of math mumbo jumbo and computer simulation magic) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) our posterior probability distribution for \\(\\rho\\) (i.e., our beliefs about the truth).\nThis journey shows how our beliefs about the truth develop through our work. We begin with \\(\\rho\\); \\(\\rho\\) is the truth, the true but unknown value we are estimating. \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\) is our estimate for \\(\\rho\\). There can be millions and millions of \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\)’s. Next, we must estimate the standard error of our estimates (our \\(\\hat{\\rho}\\)’s) to account for the uncertainty of our predictions. Finally, we create a posterior probability distribution for \\(\\rho\\). This distribution is used to answer any questions about our urn.\nBut we must retain our humility. Even with toy examples, there is a great deal of uncertainty, more uncertainity than our models might suggest. How can we be sure, for example, that no one has surreptitiously added more beads to the urn? How can we know that the shovels are not biased in some way? In any real world project, we must remain more cautious than a naive use of our models might suggest. Given these uncertainties, we should probably estimate a broader confidence interval for \\(\\rho\\), more like 14% to 54%.\nIs that increase based on data? No. We use all our data in our models. The increase is based on our experience. Stay humble. You don’t know as much as you think.\nThe world is always more uncertain than our models would have us believe.",

    "text": "4.1 Wisdom\nIn Chapter 2, we learned how to do inference. We created a joint distribution of the models under consideration and the data which might be observed. Once we observed the data, we went from the joint distribution to the conditional distribution of possible models given the data which we did, in fact, observe. That conditional distribution, suitably normalized, was our posterior probability distribution over the space of possible models. With that distribution, we can answer any question we might (reasonably) ask.\nBut what a pain in the ass that whole process was! Do professionals actually go through all those steps every time they work on a data science problem? No! That would be absurd. Instead, professionals use standard tools which, in an automated fashion, take care of those steps, taking us directly from assumptions and data to the posterior:\n\\[\\text{Prob}(\\text{models} | \\text{data} = \\text{data we observed})\\]\nEven then, however, the relative likelihood of different models is not that important. Models are invisible, mental entities with no more physical presence than unicorns or leprechauns. In the world itself, we make and test predictions. People with better models make better predictions. That is what matters.\nIn Chapter 3, we learned about sampling, the process of gathering data to answer our questions. In this chapter, we will learn about constructing models, creating the data generating mechanism (DGM) which we will use to answer our questions.\nWe always use the Cardinal Virtues. Wisdom helps us to clarify the questions with which we begin. We build the Preceptor Table which, if no data were missing, would allow us to answer the question. We check for validity. Justice creates the Population Table and examines the assumptions of stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness. With Courage, we create a data generating mechanism (DGM). Temperance helps us to use that DGM to answer the questions with which we began.\nAs (almost) always, we start by loading the tidyverse package.\nIn Chapter 3, we estimated the proportion, \\(\\rho\\), of red beans in an urn. In the real world, of course, we never mess with urns. But we are often interested in unknown proportions. For example, what proportion of US citizens support specific political candidates. Imagine that it is March 15, 2024 and we want to know \\(\\rho\\), the percentage of people who will vote for President Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election. How many beads are for Biden?\nUse the Cardinal Virtues to guide your thinking.\nWisdom requires the creation of a Preceptor Table, an examination of our data, and a determination, using the concept of “validity,” as to whether or not we can (reasonably!) assume that the two come from the same population. We begin with a question:\nFor the purpose of this question, assume that it is April, 7 months before the election.",

    "text": "What proportion of all votes will be cast for Joe Biden in the 2024 election?\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Preceptor Table\nA Preceptor Table is a table with rows and columns, such that, if no data is missing, we can easily answer our questions.\nUnits: The units are individual voters. Note that this is not all American adults or even all registered voters. To answer our question, we only need information about actual voters. Any other rows would be superfluous.\nOutcome: The outcome is the candidate for whom the vote was cast. But, looking at the question, this formulation is too broad. We don’t actually need to know the name of the candidate. We just need to know if the vote was cast for Biden or not. The name of the candidate, if it was not Biden, is irrelevant to our question.\nTreatment: There is no treatment.\nCausal or predictive model: This is clearly a predictive model since there is only one outcome for each person: their vote. It would be a causal model if we were considering a treatment which might change the vote of person \\(i\\) from one candidate to another. A causal model would require two\nCovariates: There are no covariates. If the question referred to who will win the election, then we would at least have to add a column for state of residence in order to tabulate electoral votes.\nMoment in Time: The moment in time is just after Election Day 2024.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nVoter ID\nVoted for Biden\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n\n\n2\n0\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n200\n1\n\n\n201\n0\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n2078\n1\n\n\n2079\n0\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOnce we have all the information in the Preceptor Table, it is easy to calculate the proportion of all votes which were cast for Biden.\nMoreover, we could use the Preceptor Table to answer other related questions. For example, assume we wanted to know the odds that the next two people we meet, just after the election, both voted for Biden.\nWith the data in the Preceptor Table, we could create a computer simulation which, for example, draws 1,000 pairs of voters at random from the table, checks to see if they both voted for Biden, and then report the percentage of the 1,000 which meet this criteria. Of course, we will need to construct such a simulation carefully. People don’t walk around at random! They walk with friends, and friends share the same politics more often than strangers do.\nThe important point is that the Preceptor Table has the fewest rows and columns such that, if no data is missing, we can answer our question.\n\n4.1.2 EDA\nThe data we have come from a YouGov poll (pdf) of 1,559 US adult citizens, conducted March 10 - 12, 2024. There are many questions in the poll. For the purpose of answering our question, the most relevant one is:\n\nIf an election for president were going to be held now and the Democratic nominee was oe Biden and the Republican nominee was Donald Trump, would you vote for…\n\nThe allowed choice are “Joe Biden,” “Donald Trump,” “Other,” “Not Sure,” and “I would not vote.” 42% of those polled indicated Joe Biden. Although rounding makes it impossible to know for sure, we will assume that 655 of the 1,559 “US adult citizens” would vote for Biden. Our data looks like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolling Data\n\n\nPoll ID\nWould Vote for Biden\n\n\n\n\n1\n0\n\n\n2\n0\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n200\n1\n\n\n201\n0\n\n\n...\n...\n\n\n1,559\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are key differences between our data table and our Preceptor Table, despite their superficial similarities.\n\nOur Polling Data includes exactly 1,559 rows. We don’t know how many rows are in our Preceptor Table because we don’t know, today, how many people will vote in November 2024.\nThe ID column is labeled “Voter ID” in the Preceptor Table and “Poll ID” in the Polling Data. In many ways, the ID doesn’t matter. The person labeled “2” in the first table, for example, has no necessary connection to the person labeled “2” in the second table. The numbers don’t mean anything. But, conceptually, having different labels helps to highlight the issue of sampling and concerns about representativeness, concerns which we will address under Justice.\nThe variable labels differ. “Voted for Biden” is not the same thing as “Would Vote for Biden.” Indeed, the two columns represent very different things.\n\n4.1.3 Validity\nValidity is the consistency, or lack thereof, in the columns of the data set and the corresponding columns in the Preceptor Table. In order to consider the two data sets to be drawn from the same population, the columns from one must have a valid correspondence with the columns in the other. Validity, if true (or at least reasonable), allows us to construct the Population Table, which is the first step in Justice.\nOur key problem is that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between our data (which is about an reported intention to vote for Biden) and our Preceptor Table (which records an actual vote). What we tell other people we will do is often not what we actually do. Consider a voter who is embarrassed about her support for Biden. Perhaps she perceives the interviewer as a Republican and doesn’t care to admit to him, in March, her support for Biden. But, in November, in the privacy of the polling booth, she votes for Biden. In her case, the outcome from the data (what she told the pollster) did not have a valid correspondence with her behavior in the polling booth.\nWhen we “stack” our data on top of our Preceptor Table, we are assuming that intention is a valid measure of actual voting. There may be problem, as with our hypothetical example, but they are not numerous enough to matter.\nWe conclude the Wisdom section by summarizing how we hope to use the data we have to answer the question we started with:\n\nUsing data from a YouGov poll of 1,559 US adult citizens, conducted March 10 - 12, 2024, we seek to understand what proportion of voters will support Biden in the 2024 election.",

    "text": "4.2 Justice\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice is the second Cardinal Virtue in data science. Justice starts with the Population Table – the data we want to have, the data which we actually have, and all the other data from that same population. Each row of the Population Table is defined by a unique unit/time combination. We explore three key issues. First, does the relationship among the variables demonstrate stability, meaning is the model stable across different time periods? Second, are the rows associated with the data and, separately, the rows associated with the Preceptor Table representative of all the units from the population? Third, for causal models only, we consider unconfoundedness.\n\n4.2.1 Population Table\nWe use the Population Table to acknowledge the wider source from which we could have collected our data. It includes rows from three sources: the data for units we want to have (the Preceptor Table), the data for units which we have (our actual data), and the data for units we do not care about (the rest of the population, not included in the data or in the Preceptor Table). Consider:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource\nTime\nID\nBiden\n\n\n\n…\nFebruary 2024\n1\n?\n\n\n…\nFebruary 2024\n200\n?\n\n\n…\nFebruary 2024\n976\n?\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nData\nMarch 2024\n1\n0\n\n\nData\nMarch 2024\n200\n1\n\n\nData\nMarch 2024\n…\n…\n\n\nData\nMarch 2024\n1559\n1\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n…\nOctober 2024\n1\n?\n\n\n…\nOctober 2024\n200\n?\n\n\n…\nOctober 2024\n2025\n?\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nPreceptor Table\nNovember 2024\n1\n1\n\n\nPreceptor Table\nNovember 2024\n200\n0\n\n\nPreceptor Table\nNovember 2024\n2078\n1\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n…\nDecember 2024\n1\n?\n\n\n…\nDecember 2024\n200\n?\n\n\n…\nDecember 2024\n2300\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nEvery row in a Population Table corresponds to a unit/time combination. This is different from the Preceptor Table and the data, in both of which each row is for a unit. The entire Preceptor Table and data each have a specific time associated with them, even if that moment corresponds to a few days or longer. Nothing in this imperfect world is ever instantaneous.\nA Population Table will usually have several types of columns: id, time, covariates, and outcome(s). There are no covariates in this simple example, but we will use them in later chapters.\nNow that we have created our Population Table, we can analyze the key assumptions of stability, representativeness and unconfoundedness.\n\n4.2.2 Stability\nStability means that the relationship between the columns in the Population Table is the same for three categories of rows: the data, the Preceptor Table, and the larger population from which both are drawn.\nOur Population Table is so simple that stability is true almost automatically true. There is only one column! Stability might become important as we think about the actual process by which we might meet the two voters in our original question, but, in terms of the Population Table itself, there is no problem.\n\n4.2.3 Representativeness\nRepresentativeness, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationship, among the rows in the Population Table. The first is between the Preceptor Table and the other rows. The second is between our data and the other rows. Ideally, we would like both the Preceptor Table and our data to be random samples from the population. Sadly, this is almost never the case.\nThe sampling mechanism is the technical term for the process by which some people were sampled and some were not. We hope that all members of the population have the same chance of being sampled, or else our data might be unrepresentative of the larger population. Another term for this would be having a “biased” sample. Almost all samples have some bias, but we must make a judgement call to see if the data we have is close enough to the data we want (i.e., the Preceptor Table) that we can consider both as coming from the same population.\nOne concern might involve the process by which YouGov sampled potential voters in March. If that process were flawed, if the people it sampled were systematically different than the people it did not, then the assumption of representativeness would fail. Imagine that YouGov only polled residents in Washington DC. That would be bad, even if everyone polled answered truthfully. We would end up with data which was much more pro-Biden than the country as a whole.\nRepresentativeness might also be a problem with regard to the Preceptor Table, even if our data was perfectly representativeness of the US population. Recall that the set of voters is much smaller than the full set of all US adults. In fact, voters as a class are systematically different from all adults. They are richer, better educated and more knowledgeable about politics. To the extent that the Preceptor Table — which is only voters — is not representative of all adults, we might have a problem.\nThe assumption of representativeness is never completely true. We can only hope/assume that it is true enough that the inferences we draw from our data can be roughly applied to our question. Let’s assume that is this case.\n\n4.2.4 Unconfoundedness\nUnconfoundedness means that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes, when we condition on pre-treatment covariates. This assumption is only relevant for causal models. We describe a model as “confounded” if this is not true. The easiest way to ensure unconfoundedness is to assign treatment randomly.\nSince this is a predictive model, we do not have to worry about unconfoundedness. There is no “treatment” which might be confounded with anything.\n\nUsing data from a YouGov poll of 1,559 US adult citizens, conducted March 10 - 12, 2024, we seek to understand what proportion of voters will support Biden in the 2024 election. Biden’s popularity might change significantly over the course of the election campaign.",

    "text": "4.3 Courage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice verifies the Population Table. Courage creates a mathematical model which connects the outcome variable to the covariates, if any. Then, using code, we create a fitted model, including posterior probability distributions for all the unknown parameters.\nGiven that the polling problem is conceptually similar to the beads-in-an-urn problem, it is useful to perform the same back-of-the-envelope calculation we did in Chapter 3. To do that, we first need to create the tibble:\n\npoll_data &lt;- tibble(biden = c(rep(1, 655), \n                              rep(0, 904)))\n\nslice_sample(poll_data, n = 10)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 1\n   biden\n   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     0\n 2     0\n 3     0\n 4     1\n 5     1\n 6     0\n 7     0\n 8     0\n 9     1\n10     0\n\n\nFirst, calculate the mean. This is our estimate of the center of the posterior distribution for \\(\\rho\\), the unknown proportion of the voters who support Biden.\n\nmean(poll_data$biden)\n\n[1] 0.4201411\n\n\n42% of the sample support Biden. Second, calculate the standard error of this estimate, by taking the standard deviation of the data and dividing it by the square root of the number of observations.\n\nsd(poll_data$biden) / sqrt(length(poll_data$biden))\n\n[1] 0.01250475\n\n\nThe standard error is about 1.25%. This suggests that a 95% confidence interval for the true value of \\(\\rho\\) would be:\n\nc(mean(poll_data$biden) - 2 * sd(poll_data$biden) / sqrt(length(poll_data$biden)),\n  mean(poll_data$biden) + 2 * sd(poll_data$biden) / sqrt(length(poll_data$biden)))\n\n[1] 0.3951316 0.4451506\n\n\nThe margin of error, which is another term for two times the standard error, is about 2.5%. This is less than the value of 3.5% given in the pdf. The reason for the difference involves all the technical adjustments which YouGov needs to make to their estimate. We ignore those problems and so our value is probably too small.\n\nThe data generating mechanism, or DGM, is a mathematical formula which mimics the process by which the data comes to us. The DGM for sampling scenarios with only two possible values is called Bernoulli, usually denoted as:\n\n\\[ biden_i  \\sim Bernoulli(\\rho) \\] Each voter \\(i\\) might vote for Biden or vote for someone else. It is convenient to define the model in terms of whether or not the vote was for Biden. If the vote was for Biden, the value drawn is 1, which is the standard way of representing TRUE. In other words, \\(biden_i = 1\\) means that voter \\(i\\) voted for Biden. Similarly, a vote for anyone else but Biden is indicated with 0, meaning that it is FALSE that the the vote was for Biden. \\(\\rho\\) is the only parameter in a Bernoulli model. It is the probability that a 1, instead of a 0, is drawn. That is, \\(\\rho\\) is the probability of a Biden vote, which is the same thing as the proportion of all votes which were cast for Biden, assuming again that the sampling mechanism is not biased.\nWe typical estimate the unknown parameter \\(\\rho\\) from the Bernoulli model by using a logit regression:\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0}}\n\\]\nThere are generally two parts for a statistical model: family and link function. The family is the probability distribution which generates the randomness in our data. The link function is the mathematical formula which links our data to the unknown parameters in the probability distribution. We will be reviewing these concepts over and over again in the rest of the Primer, so don’t worry if things are a little unclear right now.\n\n\n4.3.1 Models\nLoad the brms package:\n\nlibrary(brms)\n\nThe brms package provides a user-friendly interface to work with the statistical language Stan, the leading tool for Bayesian model building.\n\n4.3.1.1 Gaussian\nThe key function in the brms package is brm().\n\nfit_gauss &lt;- brm(formula = biden ~ 1,\n                data = poll_data)\n\nCompiling Stan program...\n\n\nStart sampling\n\n\n\nSAMPLING FOR MODEL 'anon_model' NOW (CHAIN 1).\nChain 1: \nChain 1: Gradient evaluation took 6e-05 seconds\nChain 1: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0.6 seconds.\nChain 1: Adjust your expectations accordingly!\nChain 1: \nChain 1: \nChain 1: Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration:  200 / 2000 [ 10%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration:  400 / 2000 [ 20%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration:  600 / 2000 [ 30%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration:  800 / 2000 [ 40%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling)\nChain 1: \nChain 1:  Elapsed Time: 0.099 seconds (Warm-up)\nChain 1:                0.089 seconds (Sampling)\nChain 1:                0.188 seconds (Total)\nChain 1: \n\nSAMPLING FOR MODEL 'anon_model' NOW (CHAIN 2).\nChain 2: \nChain 2: Gradient evaluation took 2.9e-05 seconds\nChain 2: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0.29 seconds.\nChain 2: Adjust your expectations accordingly!\nChain 2: \nChain 2: \nChain 2: Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup)\nChain 2: Iteration:  200 / 2000 [ 10%]  (Warmup)\nChain 2: Iteration:  400 / 2000 [ 20%]  (Warmup)\nChain 2: Iteration:  600 / 2000 [ 30%]  (Warmup)\nChain 2: Iteration:  800 / 2000 [ 40%]  (Warmup)\nChain 2: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup)\nChain 2: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling)\nChain 2: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%]  (Sampling)\nChain 2: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%]  (Sampling)\nChain 2: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%]  (Sampling)\nChain 2: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%]  (Sampling)\nChain 2: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling)\nChain 2: \nChain 2:  Elapsed Time: 0.099 seconds (Warm-up)\nChain 2:                0.095 seconds (Sampling)\nChain 2:                0.194 seconds (Total)\nChain 2: \n\nSAMPLING FOR MODEL 'anon_model' NOW (CHAIN 3).\nChain 3: \nChain 3: Gradient evaluation took 3.3e-05 seconds\nChain 3: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0.33 seconds.\nChain 3: Adjust your expectations accordingly!\nChain 3: \nChain 3: \nChain 3: Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup)\nChain 3: Iteration:  200 / 2000 [ 10%]  (Warmup)\nChain 3: Iteration:  400 / 2000 [ 20%]  (Warmup)\nChain 3: Iteration:  600 / 2000 [ 30%]  (Warmup)\nChain 3: Iteration:  800 / 2000 [ 40%]  (Warmup)\nChain 3: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup)\nChain 3: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling)\nChain 3: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%]  (Sampling)\nChain 3: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%]  (Sampling)\nChain 3: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%]  (Sampling)\nChain 3: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%]  (Sampling)\nChain 3: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling)\nChain 3: \nChain 3:  Elapsed Time: 0.098 seconds (Warm-up)\nChain 3:                0.112 seconds (Sampling)\nChain 3:                0.21 seconds (Total)\nChain 3: \n\nSAMPLING FOR MODEL 'anon_model' NOW (CHAIN 4).\nChain 4: \nChain 4: Gradient evaluation took 3.4e-05 seconds\nChain 4: 1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0.34 seconds.\nChain 4: Adjust your expectations accordingly!\nChain 4: \nChain 4: \nChain 4: Iteration:    1 / 2000 [  0%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration:  200 / 2000 [ 10%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration:  400 / 2000 [ 20%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration:  600 / 2000 [ 30%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration:  800 / 2000 [ 40%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1000 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Warmup)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1001 / 2000 [ 50%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1200 / 2000 [ 60%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1400 / 2000 [ 70%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1600 / 2000 [ 80%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 1800 / 2000 [ 90%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: Iteration: 2000 / 2000 [100%]  (Sampling)\nChain 4: \nChain 4:  Elapsed Time: 0.102 seconds (Warm-up)\nChain 4:                0.094 seconds (Sampling)\nChain 4:                0.196 seconds (Total)\nChain 4: \n\n\nNotes:\n\nbrm() produces a great deal of output, as you can see above. This is useful if there is some sort of problem. But, most of the time, we don’t care. So we suppress the output in the rest of the Primer, using refresh = 0 and silent = 2.\nWe almost always assign the result of a brm() call to an object, as here. By convention, the name of that object begins with “fit” because it is a fitted model object. This model was created quickly but larger models take longer. So, we assign the result to an object so we don’t need to recreate it.\nThe first argument to brm() is formula. This is provided using the R formula syntax in which the dependent variable, red is separated from the independent variables by a tilde: ~. This is the standard approach in almost all R model estimating functions. In this case, the only independent variable is a constant, which is represented with a 1.\nThe second argument to brm() is data, which is a tibble containing the data used to estimate the model parameters. The variables specified in the formula must match the variables in the tibble which is passed in, which is .\nBecause the fitting process is random, if we run this code again we will get a (very slightly) different answer. In most applications, the differences are too small to matter. But, they are annoying! So, we use the seed argument so that your result will match ours.\n\n\nfit_gauss &lt;- brm(formula = biden ~ 1,\n                data = poll_data,\n                refresh = 0,\n                silent = 2,\n                seed = 9)\n\n\n\nPrint out the model object.\n\nfit_gauss\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: biden ~ 1 \n   Data: poll_data (Number of observations: 1559) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nRegression Coefficients:\n          Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept     0.42      0.01     0.40     0.44 1.00     3949     2944\n\nFurther Distributional Parameters:\n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     0.49      0.01     0.48     0.51 1.00     3816     2236\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS\nand Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential\nscale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\n\n\nThere are many details. We will take a first pass here, leaving out elements which we will return to in later chapters. Highlights:\n\nThe “Family” is “gaussian,” which is the default value for the family argument in brms(). In the next example, we will provide the family argument explicitly. Gaussian is another term for the normal distribution. Using “gaussian” is almost certainly a mistake on our part, but “discovering” this mistake and then fixing it is a useful exercise.\nThe “Links” are “identity” for both “mu” and “sigma.” Recall the the gaussian/normal distribution is specified as \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) in which \\(\\mu\\), or “mu,” is the parameter for the mean or center of the distribution and \\(\\sigma\\), or “sigma,” is the parameter for the standard deviation or spread of the distribution.\n\n\nThe “Formula” is biden ~ 1, which is what we passed in to the formula argument when we called brm().\nThe “Data” is poll_data, which is what we passed in to the data argument when we called brm(). Note the reminder that there are 1,559 observations. Never hurts to check that the reported number of observations matches what you expect.\nFitting Bayesian models is computationally complex. The information about “Draws,” and the values for “Rhat,” “Bulk_ESS,” and “Tail_ESS” refer to those complexities. The bottom message gives a basic explanation. Don’t worry about any of that now.\nThe “Intercept” is the key part of the model. Because the family is (incorrectly!) Gaussian and the link function an identity, the actual model we are estimating looks like:\n\n\\[ biden_i =  \\mu + \\epsilon_i \\]\nwith \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). \\(y_i\\) is the height of male \\(i\\). \\(\\mu\\) is true proportion of Biden voters. \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is the “error term,” the difference between the vote of person \\(i\\) and the true proportion of Biden voters. The obvious problem with this is that \\(\\mu\\), also called the “Intercept,” is about 0.42. The value of biden is either 0 or 1. So, the value of \\(\\epsilon\\) is either -0.42 or + 0.58. No other value is possible. But that makes no sense if \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\)! This will cause problems soon.\n\nIgnoring that Gaussian/Bernoulli issue for now, we have an “Intercept” (or \\(\\mu\\)) value of 0.42. Note the complexity involved in even this simple model. We have multiple ways of describing the same concept: the true proportion of Biden voters. First, we have \\(\\rho\\), a mathematical symbol associated with Bernoulli models and to which we will return. Second, we have 1, meaning the symbol in the formula: biden ~ 1. This is an “intercept only” model, one with no covariates. Third, we have \\(\\mu\\), the standard symbol for the intercept in a intercept-only linear or Gaussian model. Fourth, we have the word “Intercept,” as in the printout from the fitted model object. In other words, \\(\\rho\\), \\(1\\), \\(\\mu\\), and Intercept all refer to the same thing!\nThe “Est.Error” is, more or less, the same thing as the standard error of our 0.42 estimate for the intercept. The full value is 0.0123, which is very close to the value we calculated by hand above.\nThe lower and upper bounds of the 95% confidence interval are indicated by “l-95% CI” and “u-95% CI.” The number also match, subject to rounding, our calculations. (We can’t use the by-hand calculations with more complex models, otherwise we would have no need for brms!)\nThe “sigma” variable in the “Family Specific Parameters” section refers to out estimate of \\(\\sigma\\), given the assumed truth of a gaussian error term. Since that assumption is clearly false, we won’t waste time interpreting the results here.\n\nOnce we have a fitted model, we can use that model, along with the R packages tidybayes and bayesplots, to answer various questions.\n\nlibrary(tidybayes)\nlibrary(bayesplot)\n\n\nWe can generate a posterior distribution for \\(\\rho\\) with:\n\nfit_gauss |&gt; \n  add_epred_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 1))\n\n# A tibble: 4,000 × 5\n# Groups:   .row [1]\n    .row .chain .iteration .draw .epred\n   &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1     NA         NA     1  0.439\n 2     1     NA         NA     2  0.398\n 3     1     NA         NA     3  0.404\n 4     1     NA         NA     4  0.417\n 5     1     NA         NA     5  0.427\n 6     1     NA         NA     6  0.431\n 7     1     NA         NA     7  0.426\n 8     1     NA         NA     8  0.408\n 9     1     NA         NA     9  0.402\n10     1     NA         NA    10  0.438\n# ℹ 3,990 more rows\n\n\nThe first argument to the key function, add_epred_draws(), is newdata. We often want to examine the behavior of the model with new data sets, data which was not used in model estimation. The object passed as newdata is generally a tibble, with a row corresponding to each set of values for the independet variables. In this case, we have an intercept-only model, which means that there are no independent variables, other than the intercept, which does not need to be explicitly passed in. So, newdata is a tibble with no variables and one row.\n\ntibble(.rows = 1)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 0\n\n\nThe resulting tibble includes 4,000 rows, each of which is a draw from the posterior distribution of \\(\\rho\\). (Recall that \\(\\rho\\) and \\(\\mu\\) refer to the same thing.) You can ignore that columns named .row, .chain, and .iteration. The .draw variable just keeps count of the draws. The key variable is .epred, which us a draw from the posterior distribution of \\(\\rho\\). The “e” in .epred stands for expected value. Grahically, we have:\n\nfit_gauss |&gt; \n  add_epred_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 1)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = .epred)) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n                   bins = 50) + \n    labs(title = expression(paste(\"Posterior Probability Distribution of \", rho)),\n         subtitle = \"Distribution is centered at 42%\",\n         x = expression(paste(\"Proportion, \", rho, \", of Biden Voters\")),\n         y = \"Probability\") + \n  \n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven more useful than posteriors of the parameters in the model are predictions we can make with the model. The key function for exploring those predictions is add_predicted_draws(). This function behaves similarly to add_epred_draws(). In both cases, we need to provide the value for the newdata argument, generally a tibble with a column for all the variables used in the fitted model. Again, because this is an intercept-only model, there is no need for columns in the newdata tibble. No variables are used in fit_gauss.\n\nfit_gauss |&gt; \n  add_predicted_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 1))\n\n# A tibble: 4,000 × 5\n# Groups:   .row [1]\n    .row .chain .iteration .draw .prediction\n   &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1     NA         NA     1       0.418\n 2     1     NA         NA     2       0.938\n 3     1     NA         NA     3       0.198\n 4     1     NA         NA     4       0.285\n 5     1     NA         NA     5       0.162\n 6     1     NA         NA     6       0.424\n 7     1     NA         NA     7       1.40 \n 8     1     NA         NA     8      -0.144\n 9     1     NA         NA     9       0.434\n10     1     NA         NA    10       0.928\n# ℹ 3,990 more rows\n\n\nThe columns which result are the same as with add_epred_draws() except that .epred is replaced with .prediction. (The reason that all the variable names have a leading . is that this convention makes it less likely, but not impossible, that they will conflict with any variable names in the newdata tibble.)\n\n4.3.2 Tests\nA glance at the result shows the problem: .prediction takes on a variety of values. But that is impossible! By definition, the only possible values are 0/1. We must have made a mistake in specifying the model. Another way to see the model is to perform a “posterior predictive check,” a comparison of model predictions with your actual data. The bayesplot package includes the pp_check() function for that purpose.\n\npp_check(fit_gauss)\n\nUsing 10 posterior draws for ppc type 'dens_overlay' by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(y\\) is the original data. \\(y_rep\\) is a replication of the data, using the fit_gauss model. In other words, we “pretend” that fit_gauss is the true model. We then create 10 versions of the output data, as created by add_predictive_draws(), each the same size are our original data, which is 1,559 observations in this case. We then graph both \\(y\\) and the 10 versions of \\(y_rep\\).\nAs the graphic makes clear, we have a serious problem. The data, meaning the variable biden, which is referred to as \\(y\\) in the plot, is always either 0 or 1, hence the two spikes in the plot. \\(y_rep\\), on the other hand, is a continuous variable with a range of -0.8 to about 1.8. That is a contradiction! If our model were true, then the replicated values — the posterior predictions — would look a lot like our original data.\nSadly, most usage of pp_check() does not produce such a clear cut conclusion. We need to decide if \\(y\\) and \\(y_rep\\) are “close enough” that our model can be used as if it were true.\n\n4.3.2.1 Bernoulli\nWe have discovered that our initial assumption about the correct mathematical formula for the data generating mechanism was mistaken. Instead of a gaussion (or Normal) probability model, we should use a Bernoulli model. We must modify our call to brm() as follows:\n\nfit_bern &lt;- brm(formula = biden ~ 1,\n                data = poll_data,\n                family = bernoulli(),\n                refresh = 0,\n                silent = 2,\n                seed = 12)\n\nThis call to brm() is the same as the previous one, except that we have specified the value of the family argument as bernoulli(). (Note that we can give just the name of the family, which is itself a function, or include the parentheses as in bernoulli(). The results are the same.) Recall that the default value of family is gaussian() or, equivalently, guassian. In a Bernoulli data generating mechanism, we have:\n\\[ biden_i  \\sim Bernoulli(\\rho) \\]\nEach voter \\(i\\) which we sample either supports Biden or they do not. If person \\(i\\) supports Biden, the value drawn is 1, which is the standard way of representing TRUE. In other words, \\(biden_i = 1\\) means that person \\(i\\) supports Biden. Similarly, a person not supporting Biden is indicated with 0, meaning that it is FALSE that the person \\(i\\) supports Biden. \\(\\rho\\) is the only parameter in a Bernoulli model. It is the probability that a 1, instead of a 0, is drawn. That is, \\(\\rho\\) is the probability that a person supports Biden or, equivalently, the proportion of all voters who support Biden.\nConsider the fitted object:\n\nfit_bern\n\n Family: bernoulli \n  Links: mu = logit \nFormula: biden ~ 1 \n   Data: poll_data (Number of observations: 1559) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nRegression Coefficients:\n          Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept    -0.32      0.05    -0.42    -0.22 1.00     1451     1785\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS\nand Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential\nscale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\n\n\nThe output is, of course, very similar to that for fit_gauss. The “Family” is “bernoulli” rather than “gaussian.” The “Links” are “mu = logit” instead of “mu = identity.” There is no link for “sigma” because a Bernoulli model has only one parameter. The “Formula,” “Data,” and “Draws” are the same as before. In order to interpret the Intercept value of -0.32, we need to revisit the concept of a link function.\nVia my friend Claude, we have:\n\nIn statistical modeling, a link function is a mathematical function that relates the linear predictor (the linear combination of the predictors and their coefficients) to the expected value of the response variable. The link function is a key component of generalized linear models (GLMs) and is used to account for the relationship between the predictors and the response variable when the response variable follows a non-normal distribution or has a restricted range.\n\n\nThe purpose of the link function is to transform the expected value of the response variable to a scale that is unbounded and continuous, allowing it to be modeled as a linear combination of the predictors. The choice of the link function depends on the distribution of the response variable and the assumptions made about the relationship between the predictors and the response.\n\nDon’t worry if this is difficult to understand, we will revisit in future chapters.\nThe default link function for a Bernoulli model is logit, as in:\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{e^{\\beta_0}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0}}\n\\] By definition, the parameter \\(\\rho\\) is only allowed to take values between 0 and 1. We want to constrain the model so that only these values are even possible. Using the Gaussian model was a bad choice because it allows for values anywhere from positive to negative infinity. The magic of the link function, as you can see, is that it can only ever produce a number close to zero, if \\(\\beta_0\\) is very small, or close to one, if \\(\\beta_0\\) is very large. In other words, the model structure (which is a “logit” function) “bakes in” the restrictions on \\(\\rho\\) from the very start. We call this a “link” function because it links the unknown parameters we are estimating (\\(\\beta_0\\) in this case) to the paramter(s) (just one parameter, \\(\\rho\\), in this case, ) which are part of the data generating mechanism. Once we have \\(\\rho\\) (or, more precisely, the posterior distribution of \\(\\rho\\)) we no longer care about \\(\\beta_0\\).\nWe can now interpret the value of the Intercept (which is the same thing as \\(\\mu\\) in this case, but not the same thing as \\(\\rho\\)) as the value of \\(\\beta_0\\). In fact, the most common mathematical symbol for the intercept of a statistical model is \\(\\beta_0\\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\rho &=& \\frac{e^{\\beta_0}}{1 + e^{\\beta_0}}\\\n\\rho &=& \\frac{e^{-0.32}}{1 + e^{-0.32}}\\\n\\rho &\\approx& 0.42\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0.42 is the same number we calculated by hand and the same result when we used family = gaussian(). We can calculate the values for the upper and lower 95% confidence intervals by plugging -0.22 and -0.42 into the same formula.\nWe can create the entire posterior distribution for \\(\\rho\\) using similar code as before:\n\nfit_bern |&gt; \n  add_epred_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 1)) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = .epred)) + \n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n                   bins = 50) + \n    labs(title = expression(paste(\"Posterior Probability Distribution of \", rho)),\n         subtitle = \"Distribution is centered at 42%\",\n         x = expression(paste(\"Proportion, \", rho, \", of Biden Voters\")),\n         y = \"Probability\") + \n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf both fit_gauss and fit_bern produce the same posterior distribution for \\(\\rho\\), then who cares which one we use? The answer is that fit_bern produces reasonable posterior predictions:\n\nfit_bern |&gt; \n  add_predicted_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 1))\n\n# A tibble: 4,000 × 5\n# Groups:   .row [1]\n    .row .chain .iteration .draw .prediction\n   &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;       &lt;int&gt;\n 1     1     NA         NA     1           1\n 2     1     NA         NA     2           0\n 3     1     NA         NA     3           0\n 4     1     NA         NA     4           1\n 5     1     NA         NA     5           0\n 6     1     NA         NA     6           1\n 7     1     NA         NA     7           0\n 8     1     NA         NA     8           0\n 9     1     NA         NA     9           0\n10     1     NA         NA    10           0\n# ℹ 3,990 more rows\n\n\nAll the values of .prediction are either zero or one, as we expect. Consider:\n\npp_check(fit_bern, type = \"bars\")\n\nUsing 10 posterior draws for ppc type 'bars' by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing type = \"bars\" is a good choice for pp_check() when family is bernoulli(). Note how the 10 replications of \\(y_rep\\) are indistinguishable from the true output values \\(y\\). A good model produces replications, sometimes termed “fake data,” which is indistinguishable for the actual data.\n\n4.3.3 Data Generating Mechanism\nWe now have our data generating mechansim:\n\\[ biden_i  \\sim Bernoulli(\\rho = 0.42) \\]\n\n\nUsing data from a YouGov poll of 1,559 US adult citizens, conducted March 10 - 12, 2024, we seek to understand what proportion of voters will support Biden in the 2024 election. Biden’s popularity might change significantly over the course of the election campaign. In the poll, Biden’s support was much less than 50%.\n\nWe have not yet used our DGM to answer our question. But, the DGM itself, prior to us asking any specific question, includes all sorts of interesting information. It is sensible for us to add one aspect of that information to our summary of the work done so far.",

    "text": "4.4 Temperance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourage produced the data generating mechanism. Temperance guides us in the use of the DGM — or the “model” — we have created to answer the questions with which we began. We create posteriors for the quantities of interest. We should be modest in the claims we make. The posteriors we create are never the “truth.” The assumptions we made to create the model are never perfect. Yet decisions made with flawed posteriors are almost always better than decisions made without them.\n\n4.4.1 Questions and Answers\nRecall the question with which we began:\n\nWhat proportion of all votes will be cast for Joe Biden in the 2024 election?\n\nLet’s use fit_bern to answer this question with the help of add_epred_draws().\n\nfit_bern |&gt; \n  add_epred_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 1)) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    lower_95 = quantile(.epred, 0.025),\n    median = quantile(.epred, 0.5),\n    upper_95 = quantile(.epred, 0.975)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n   .row lower_95 median upper_95\n  &lt;int&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1    0.397  0.420    0.445\n\n\nWe can also refer to the figure we created above of the posterior probability distribution for \\(\\rho\\). Of course, if we want (mostly) precise numbers, we need to do more than just stare at a graphic. We should calculate precise quantiles from the posterior distribution.\n\nUsing data from a YouGov poll of 1,559 US adult citizens, conducted March 10 - 12, 2024, we seek to understand what proportion of voters will support Biden in the 2024 election. Biden’s popularity might change significantly over the course of the election campaign. In the poll, Biden’s support was much less than 50%. We estimate that Biden’s percentage of the vote in Election Day will be about 42%, plus or minus 2.5%.\n\n\n4.4.2 Humility\nWe can never know the truth.\nRecall all the ways in which are DGM is a poor description of reality. We assume representativeness. But that is false! We know that our sample is not perfectly representative of the people who will be voting in the election. No poll is ever perfect. The sort of people who answer polling questions are systematically different from those who do not. Professionals will do their best to “control” for those differences, a topic beyond the scope of this Primer, but those controls will never be perfect.\nWe also assume stability in constructing our DGM. This is certainly false. The 0.42 estimate is highly unlikely to stay stable throughout the election campaign.\nLife is not a textbook. We first calculate the textbook answer, with all of its absurd assumptions. We then use that answer, along with our other knowledge, to produce the best possible estimate for our quantity of interest along with our uncertainty about that estimate.\nOur initial answer to the question has two major problems. First, it does not use information about other US presidential elections. Second, it is over-confident because it assumes that the model’s assumptions are correct.\nA better answer would be:\n\nUsing data from a YouGov poll of 1,559 US adult citizens, conducted March 10 - 12, 2024, we seek to understand what proportion of voters will support Biden in the 2024 election. Biden’s popularity might change significantly over the course of the election campaign. In the poll, Biden’s support was much less than 50%. We estimate that Biden’s percentage of the vote in Election Day will be about 44%, plus or minus 5%.\n\nWait!?! This is not what the model reported!\nWhere did that 44% come from? The model estimated 42%. But, the problem, as always, is that our models are always flawed. They always assume things that are false. They always leave out lots of information. For example, no Democrat has won less than 43% of the votes for president since Walter Mondale in 1980. Is Biden really a worse candidate then every other Democrat in almost 50 years? Probably not.\nDoes that history “prove” anything? No! History suggests. It does not construct proofs. Your job as a data scientist is not simply to read the numbers from your R Console. Your job is to combine those numbers with other sources of information and then offer your best estimate for the quantity of interest.\nWhere did that “plus or minus 5%” come from? The 95% confidence (or uncertainty or whatever) intervals provided by brms run from about 39.7% to 44.5%. That would suggest a plus/minus range of somewhere between 2.3% and 2.5%.\nYou always need to be prepared to give two ranges of uncertainty related to your quantity of interest. First, is the range provided by the model, the one which assumes that every aspect of the model is perfectly true. For this range to be correct, every assumption must be true.\nBut, in addition to the computer output, you bring your experience to bear. You know that polls are volatile. You know that polling is hard. In general, the uncertainty interval provided by the model is a floor for the true uncertainty.\nThe world is always more uncertain than our models would have us believe.",

The reason is that the world confronts us. Make decisions we must. We must decide between options X or Y. We must choose from actions A, B and C. Confronted by a choice, we need to make a model of the world to help us choose wisely.\nThe real world is complex.

    "text": "5.1.1 Preceptor Table\nWhich rows and columns of data do you need such that, if you had them all, the calculation of the quantity of interest would be trivial? The steps we usually take to construct the Preceptor Table include:\nUnits: All the adults in the world, one row per person.\nOutcome: This is the variable which we are trying to explain/understand/predict. This is not the same thing as the answer to the question we have been asked. Our question is aboit average height, but the height of each individual is our outcome variable. If we can build a model which explains/understands/predicts individual height, we can use that model to answer our questions about average height.\nTreatment: There are no treatment variables.\nCausal or predictive model: We have only one outcome, so the model is predictive.\nCovariates: Since our question asks about the difference between men and women, at least one of our covariates must be sex.\nMoment in Time: This is often implicit in the question itself. One of our key roles as data scientists is to clarify the questions which we are asked. In this case, it seems clear that the questions refer to now, the present moment.\nPredictive models care nothing about causation. Causal models are often also concerned with prediction, if only as a means of measuring the quality of the model. Here, we are looking at prediction.\nSo, what does our Preceptor Table look like? Assuming we are predicting height for every adult on Earth at this moment in time, we would have height data for every person at least 18 years of age. This means that we would have about 8 billion rows, one for each adult, along with a column for each individual’s height and sex.\nHere are some rows from our Preceptor Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nOutcome\n\n\nCovariate\n\n\n\nHeight\nSex\n\n\n\n\n1\n150\nF\n\n\n2\n172\nM\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n5000\n160\nM\n\n\n5001\n142\nF\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nN\n190\nM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis table would extend all the way until person 8 billion-and-something.

There are 353 missing values of height in our subset of data. Just using glimpse() does not show us that. Let’s filter out the NA’s using drop_na(). This will delete the rows in which the value of any variable is missing. To make the statistical inference a bit more interesting, we will just use 50 observations from the data. Of course, in a real problem, we would use all the data we have.\n\n# We use set.seed() to ensure that anyone running this code will get the same\n# set of observations in their tibble.

Only if the assumption of validity makes sense.\n\n5.1.3 Validity\nValidity refers to whether columns from different datasets represent the same concept. For example, does “height” in the Preceptor Table mean the same as “height” in NHANES? Most likely, yes. However, we need to watch for differences like measurement units—centimeters versus inches—or whether people were measured with shoes on or off. These kinds of differences could mean that the height columns don’t truly align. Still, overall, the NHANES 2010 height data is a valid stand-in for modern height measurements. That means we can reasonably stack the two datasets and treat them as if they come from the same population. The same logic applies to the sex variable.\nSince validity holds, we can combine the Preceptor Table and our data into a Population Table.\n\n5.1.4 Population\nThe population is not the set of people for which we have data — the participants in the CDC’s Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 2009 to 2011. This is the data set. Nor is it the set of all the individuals about whom we would like to have data. Those are the rows in the Preceptor Table. The population is the larger — potentially much larger — set of individuals which include both the data we have and the data we want. Generally, the population will be much larger than either the data we have or the data we want. In fact, there is almost always a time dimension to consider. We generally want to make inferences about right now or about the future. By definition, the data we have is always from the past.\nIn this case, we want to estimate average height for adults today, not for people in 2009 – 2011. We also want to estimate height for adults outside the United States, a group that is excluded from our data set. Is it reasonable to generate conclusions for the world from this group? Maybe? We have limited data to work with and we have to determine how far we are willing to generalize to other groups.\nIt is a judgment call, a matter of Wisdom, as to whether or not we may assume that the data we have and the data we want to have (i.e., the Preceptor Table) are drawn from the same population.\nIn the social sciences, there is never a perfect relationship between the data you have and the question you are trying to answer. Data for American adults in the past is not the same thing as data for American adults today. Nor is it the same as the data for adults in France or Mexico. Yet, this data is relevant. Right? It is certainly better than nothing.\nUsing not-perfect data is generally better than using no data at all.\nIs not-perfect data always better? No! If your problem is estimating the median height of 5th grade girls in Tokyo, we doubt that our data is at all relevant. Wisdom recognizes the danger of using non-relevant data to build a model and then mistakenly using that model in a way which will only make the situation worse. If the data won’t help, don’t use the data, don’t build a model. Better to just use your common sense and experience. Or find better data.",

These rows contain entries for our covariate, sex, but they do not contain any outcome results.\nOur actual data rows contain the information that we do know. These rows contain entries for both our covariates and the outcomes. In this case, the actual data comes from a study conducted on males in 2009-2011, so our sex entries for these rows will read “Male” and our year entries of these rows will either read “2009”, “2010”, or “2011”.\nOur other rows contain no data. These are subjects which fall under our desired population, but for which we have no data. As such, all outcomes and covariates are missing. (A subtle point is that, even for other data, we “know” the ID and the Year for each subject. Of course, we don’t really know these things, but, conceptually, we are defining the meaning of those rows on the basis of those variables.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Table\n\n\nID\nSource\nYear\nSex\nHeight\n\n\n\n\nP1\nPreceptor\n2024\nMale\n?\n\n\nP2\nPreceptor\n2024\nFemale\n?\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nD1\nActual\n2009\nMale\n180\n\n\nD2\nActual\n2010\nFemale\n160\n\n\nD3\nActual\n2011\nMale\n168\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nO1\nOther\n?\n?\n?\n\n\nO2\nOther\n?\n?\n?\n\n\nO3\nOther\n?\n?\n?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Stability\n\nStability means that the relationship between the columns in the Population Table is the same for three categories of rows: the data, the Preceptor Table, and the larger population from which both are drawn.\n\n\n5.2.3 Representativeness\n\nRepresentativeness, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationships among the rows in the Population Table.

    "section": "\n5.3 Courage",
    "text": "5.3 Courage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn data science, we deal with words, math, and code, but the most important of these is code. We need Courage to create the model, to take the leap of faith that we can make our ideas real.\nJustice gave us the Population Table. Courage selects the data generating mechanism. We first specify the mathematical formula which connects the outcome variable we are interested in with the other data that we have. We explore different models. We need to decide which variables to include and to estimate the values of unknown parameters. We check our models for consistency with the data we have. We avoid hypothesis tests. We select one model.\nWe use a simple linear model:\n\\[ y_i =  \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 sexMale + \\epsilon_i \\]\nwith \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). \\(y_i\\) is the height of adult \\(i\\). … \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is the “error term,” the difference between the height of male \\(i\\) and the average height of all males.\n\\(\\epsilon_i\\) is normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of \\(\\sigma\\).\nNote:\n\nThe model has three unknown parameters: \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\), and \\(\\sigma\\). Before we can do anything else we need to estimate the values of these parameters. Can we ever know their exact value? No! Perfection lies only in God’s own R code. But, by using an approach similar to what we used in Chapters Chapter 2 and Chapter 4, we will be able to create a posterior probability distribution for each parameter.\n\n\nThe model is wrong, as are all models.\nThe parameter we most care about is \\(\\mu\\). That is the parameter with a substantively meaningful interpretation. Not only is the meaning of \\(\\sigma\\) difficult to describe, we also don’t particular care about its value. Parameters like \\(\\sigma\\) in this context are nuisance or auxiliary parameters. We still estimate their posterior distributions, but we don’t really care what those posteriors look like.\n\\(\\mu\\) is not the average height of the men in the sample. We can calculate that directly. It is 169.142. No estimation required! Instead, \\(\\mu\\) is the average height of men in the population. Recall from the discussions in Chapter 4 that the population is the universe of people/units/whatever about which we seek to draw conclusions. On some level, this seems simple. On a deeper level, it is very subtle. For example, if we are walking around Copenhagen, then the population we really care about, in order to answer our three questions, is the set of adult men which we might meet today. This is not the same as the population of adult men in the US in 2010. But is it close enough? Is it better than nothing? We want to assume that both men from nhanes (the data we have) and men we meet in Copenhagen today (the data we want to have) are drawn from the same population. Each case is a different and the details matter.\n\\(\\sigma\\) is an estimate for the standard deviation of the errors, i.e., variability in height after accounting for the mean.\n\n\n5.3.1 Models\nLet’s estimate a simple version of the model. Load the tidymodels package.\n\nlibrary(tidymodels)\n\nBecause we are estimating a linear model, we begin with:\n\nfit_1 &lt;- linear_reg() |&gt; \n  set_engine(\"lm\") |&gt; \n  fit(height ~ 1 + sex, data = x)\n\nfit_1\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = height ~ 1 + sex, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)      sexMale  \n     164.74         9.56  \n\n\n\nShow the codelibrary(equatiomatic)\n\n\nAttaching package: 'equatiomatic'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:modeldata':\n\n    penguins\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:datasets':\n\n    penguins\n\nShow the codeextract_eq(fit_1$fit, intercept = \"beta\")\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{height} = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}(\\operatorname{sex}_{\\operatorname{Male}}) + \\epsilon\n\\]\n\n\n\nShow the codeextract_eq(fit_1$fit, \n           intercept = \"beta\", \n           use_coefs = TRUE, \n           coef_digits = 0)\n\n\\[\n\\operatorname{\\widehat{height}} = 165 + 10(\\operatorname{sex}_{\\operatorname{Male}})\n\\]\n\n\nThere is a direct connection between the mathematical form of the model created under Justice and the code we use to fit the model under Courage. height ~ 1 + sex is the code equivalent of \\(y_i =  \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 sexMale\\).\nThere are several ways to examine the fitted model. The simplest is to print it. Recall that just typing x at the prompt is the same as writing print(x).\n\nfit_1\n\nparsnip model object\n\n\nCall:\nstats::lm(formula = height ~ 1 + sex, data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)      sexMale  \n     164.74         9.56  \n\n\nThe (Intercept) is the same thing as \\(\\beta_0\\) in the mathematical description of the model. In other words, we are speaking three languages here: English (“Intercept”), math ($beta_0$), and code (~ 1). But all three languages are referring to the same underlying concept.\nThe intercept (1) is automatically included in R regression models by default, so we can leave it out. In other words, height ~ 1 + sex is the same model as height ~ sex.\nLoad the broom package to examine the fitted model with the tidy() function.\n\nlibrary(broom)\n\ntidy(fit_1, conf.int = TRUE)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 7\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value conf.low conf.high\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)   165.        1.10    149.   1.10e-65   163.       167. \n2 sexMale         9.56      1.63      5.87 3.91e- 7     6.29      12.8\n\n\nThe intercept (about 165 cm) estimates the average height for females (the reference group). The coefficient for sexMale (around 9.56 cm) shows that males are on average taller by that amount compared to females.\n\n\nx |&gt; \n  summarise(avg_heigh = mean(height), .by = sex)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  sex    avg_heigh\n  &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Male        174.\n2 Female      165.\n\n\nThe average heights confirm the regression results: males average about 174 cm and females about 165 cm in this sample.\n\nThe estimated error (“Est.Error”) also makes sense. This is the standard error and can be calculated by hand as the standard deviation of the data divided by the squart root of the number of observations:\n\n\nsd(x$height) / sqrt(3658)\n\n[1] 0.1230646\n\n\n\nThe end points of the confidence intervals are simply the estimate \\(\\pm\\) two times the standard error.\nWe don’t really care about the values associated with sigma, which has no physical meaning. Parameters like this are often referred to as “nuisance” parameters because, although they are necessary to constructing the fitted model, we don’t really care about them outside that context. The Intercept, on the other hand, is the mean of our posterior distribution for the unknown parameter \\(\\mu\\), the average height of an adult male.\n\n5.3.2 Data Generating Mechanism\nWe modeled height, a continuous variable measured in centimeters, as a linear function of a constant term. The average adult male height in the US was around 176 cm. Mathematically:\n\\[ height_i =  176 + \\epsilon_i \\]\nwith \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, 0.75^2)\\).\n\n5.3.3 Tests\nBefore excepting fit_1 as our data generating mechanism, we should perform a posterior predictive check.\n\nShow the code## tidymodels::pp_check(fit_1)\n\n\nNote how similar our actual data, \\(y\\), is to the 10 versions of the replicated data, \\(y_rep\\). They are close enough that we are happy to use fit_1. However, the match is not perfect! The actual data is slightly more “peaked” and also features some weird bumps in the tails, especially around 200 cm. It would be possible, but not easy, to modify our model to match the actual data more closely. For now, we will just accept fit_1 as our data generating mechanism.",

    "text": "5.4 Temperance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4.1 Questions and Answers\n\nWhat is the probability that the next adult male we meet will be taller than 180 centimeters?\n\nThere are two fundamentally different kinds of unknowns which we care about: expected values and predicted values. With the former, we are not interested in any specific individual. The individual value is irrelevant. With predicted values, we care, not about the average, but about this specific person. With the former, we use add_epred_draws(). With the latter, the relevant function is add_predicted_draws(). Both functions return draws from a posterior probability distribution, but the unknown number which underlies the posterior are very different.\nRecall the mathematics:\n\\[ y_i =  \\mu + \\epsilon_i \\]\nWith expected values or averages, we can ignore the \\(\\epsilon_i\\) term in this formula. The expected value of \\(\\epsilon_i\\) is zero since, by assumption, \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). However, we can’t ignore \\(\\epsilon_i\\) when predicting the height for a single individual.\n\n# fit_1 |&gt; \n#   add_predicted_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 1))\n\nAs before, it is straightforward to turn draws from the posterior probability distribution into a graphic:\n\n# fit_1 |&gt; \n#   add_predicted_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 1)) |&gt; \n#   ggplot(aes(x = .prediction)) +\n#     geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n#                    bins = 100) +\n#     labs(title = \"Posterior for Height of Random Male\",\n#          subtitle = \"Uncertainty for a single individual is much greater than for the expected value\",\n#          x = \"Height (cm)\",\n#          y = \"Probability\",\n#          caption = \"Data source: NHANES\") + \n#     scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +\n#     scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +\n#     theme_classic()\n\nNote:\n\nThe posterior for an individual is much wider than the posterior for the expected value.\nEyeballing, seems like there is a 1 out of 3 chance that the next man we meet, or any randomly chosen man, is taller than 180 cm.\nWe can calculate the exact probability by manipulating the tibble of draws directly.\n\n\n# fit_1 |&gt; \n#   add_predicted_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 1)) |&gt; \n#   mutate(tall = if_else(.prediction &gt; 180, TRUE, FALSE)) |&gt; \n#   summarize(odds = mean(tall))\n\nIf 30% or so of the draws from the posterior probability distribution are greater than 180 cm, then there is about a 30% chance that the next individual will be taller than 180 cm.\nAgain, the key conceptual difficulty is the population. The problem we actually have involves walking around London, or wherever, today. The data we have involve America in 2010. Those are not the same things! But they are not totally different. Knowing whether the data we have is “close enough” to the problem we want to solve is at the heart of Wisdom. Yet that was the decision we made at the start of the process, the decision to create a model in the first place. Now that we have created a model, we look to the virtue of Temperance for guidance in using that model. The data we have is never a perfect match for the world we face. We need to temper our confidence and act with humility. Our forecasts will never be as good as a naive use of the model might suggest. Reality will surprise us. We need to take the model’s claims with a family-sized portion of salt.\n\nWhat is the probability that, among the next 4 men we meet, the tallest is at least 10 cm taller than the shortest?\n\nBayesian models are beautiful because, via the magic of simulation, we can answer (almost!) any question. Because the question is about four random individuals, we need add_predicted_draws() to give us four sets of draws from four identical posterior probability distributions. All we need to do is to change 1 to 4 in our previous code and then widen the data. If you need to predict X individuals, then you need a tibble with X rows, regardless of whether or not those rows are otherwise identical.\n\n# fit_1 |&gt; \n#   add_predicted_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 4)) |&gt;\n#   select(.row, .draw, .prediction) |&gt; \n#   pivot_wider(values_from = .prediction, names_from = .row)\n\nAgain, we have the subtle issue. In the same way that light is both a wave and a particle, these columns are both posteriors and draws from those posteriors, when considered row by row. In each row, we are running an experiment in which we meet 4 men. We measure their heights, we determine if the tallest is more than 10 centimeters taller than the shortest. We then do the same thing is row 2, row 3 and so on. The functions row_wise() and c_across() make this (mostly) simple.\n\n# draws &lt;- fit_1 |&gt; \n#   add_predicted_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 4)) |&gt;\n#   select(.row, .draw, .prediction) |&gt; \n#   pivot_wider(values_from = .prediction, names_from = .row) |&gt; \n#   rowwise() %&gt;%\n#   mutate(diff = max(c_across(`1`:`4`)) - min(c_across(`1`:`4`)))\n# \n# draws\n\nUnfortunately, this code can take a while to run, so we save the results in a permanent tibble named draws. This will be a common approach, just as we have saved the fitted model object as fit_1, or whatever, rather than recreating it each time.\nThe next step is to calculate the number of interest. We can not, directly, draw the height of the tallest or shortest out of 4 random men. However, having drawn 4 random men, we can calculate those numbers, and the difference between them.\nThese steps serve as a template for much of the analysis we do later. It is often very hard to create a model directly of the thing we want to know. There is no easy way to create a model which estimates this height difference directly. It is easy, however, to create a model which allows for random draws.\nGive us enough random draws, and a tibble in which to store them, and we can estimate the world.\nOnce we have random draws from the posterior distribution we care about, graphing the posterior probability distribution is the same-old, same-old.\n\nShow the code# draws %&gt;%\n#   mutate(diff = max(c_across(`1`:`4`)) - min(c_across(`1`:`4`))) |&gt; \n#   ggplot(aes(x = diff)) +\n#     geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n#                    bins = 100) +\n#     labs(title = \"Posterior for Max Height Difference Among Four Men\",\n#          subtitle = \"The expected value for this difference would be much more narrow\",\n#          x = \"Height Difference in Centimeters\",\n#          y = \"Probability\",\n#          caption = \"Data source: NHANES\") + \n#     scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 50, 10),\n#                        labels = scales::number_format()) +\n#     scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) \n\n\nThere is about an % chance that, when meeting 4 random men, the tallest will be at least 10 cm taller than the shortest. Exact calculation:\n\n# sum(draws$diff &gt; 10) / length(draws$diff)\n\n\n\nWhat is our posterior probability distribution of the height of the 3rd tallest man out of the next 100 we meet?\n\nThe same approach will work for almost any question.\n\n# fit_1 |&gt; \n#   add_predicted_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 100)) |&gt;\n#   select(.row, .draw, .prediction) |&gt; \n#   pivot_wider(values_from = .prediction, names_from = .row)\n\nAgain, we have 100 (identical) posteriors, each representing the height of a random adult male. Each column is a posterior. (In later models, the columns will represent different posteriors, but we keep things simple for now.) Each row can then be viewed as an experiment. Instead of just meeting one random man, however, we meet 100. Draws from a posterior are the same thing as one random unit from the underlying population.\nThe magic of rowwise()and c_across() allows us to easily determine the height of the tallest man out of 100.\n\n# draws &lt;- fit_1 |&gt; \n#   add_predicted_draws(newdata = tibble(.rows = 100)) |&gt;\n#   select(.row, .draw, .prediction) |&gt; \n#   pivot_wider(values_from = .prediction, names_from = .row) |&gt; \n#   rowwise() %&gt;%\n#   mutate(third_tallest = sort(c_across(`1`:`100`))[98])\n\n\nShow the code# draws |&gt; \n#   ggplot(aes(x = third_tallest, y = after_stat(count / sum(count)))) +\n#     geom_histogram(bins = 100) +\n#     labs(title = \"Posterior for Height of 3rd Tallest Man from Next 100\",\n#          subtitle = \"Should we have more or less certainty about behavior in the tails?\",\n#          x = \"Height (cm)\",\n#          y = \"Probability\",\n#          caption = \"Data source: NHANES\") + \n#     scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +\n#     scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) \n\n\n\n5.4.2 Humility\nWhen answering questions as we have been, it can be easy to falsely believe that we are delivering the truth. This is not the case. In fact, there are three primary levels of knowledge which we need to understand in order to account for our uncertainty.\nThe three primary levels of knowledge possible knowledge in our scenario include: the Truth (the Preceptor Table), the DGM Posterior, and Our Posterior.\nIf we know the Truth (with a capital “T”), then we know the Preceptor Table. With that knowledge, we can directly answer our question precisely. We can calculate each individual’s height, and any summary measure we might be interested in, like the average height for different ages or countries.\nThis level of knowledge is possible only under an omniscient power, one who can see every outcome in every individual under every treatment. The Truth would show, for any given individual, their actions under control, their actions under treatment, and each little factor that impacted those decisions.\nThe Truth represents the highest level of knowledge one can have — with it, our questions merely require algebra or, at worst, simulation. There is no need to estimate a treatment effect, or the different treatment effects for different groups of people. We would not need to predict at all — we would know.\nThe DGM posterior is the next level of knowledge, which lacks the omniscient quality of The Truth. This posterior is the posterior we would calculate if we had perfect knowledge of the data generating mechanism, meaning we have the correct model structure and exact parameter values. This is often falsely conflated with “our posterior,” which is subject to error in model structure and parameter value estimations.\nWhat we do with the DGM posterior is the same as our posterior — we estimate parameters based on data and predict the future with the latest and most relevant information possible. The difference is that, when we calculate posteriors for an unknown value in the DGM posterior, we expect those posteriors to be perfect.\nUnfortunately, our posterior possesses even less certainty! In the real world, we don’t have perfect knowledge of the DGM: the model structure and the exact parameter values. What does this mean?\nWhen we go to our boss, we tell them that this is our best guess. It is an informed estimate based on the most relevant data possible. From that data, we have created a posterior for the average height of males.\nDoes this mean we are certain that the average height lies is the most probable outcome in our posterior? Of course not! As we would tell our boss, it would not be shocking to find out that the actual average height was less or more than our estimate.\nThis is because a lot of the assumptions we make during the process of building a model, the processes in Wisdom, are subject to error. Perhaps our data did not match the future as well as we had hoped. Ultimately, we try to account for our uncertainty in our estimates. Even with this safeguard, we aren’t surprised if we are a bit off.",

    "text": "6.1 Wisdom\nModels have parameters. In Chapter 3 we created a model with a single parameter \\(\\rho\\), the proportion of red beads in an urn. In Chapter 5, we used models with two parameters: \\(\\mu\\) (the average height in the population, generically known as a model “intercept”) and \\(\\sigma\\) (the variation in height in the population). Here — can you guess where this is going? — we will build models with three parameters: \\(\\sigma\\) and two “coefficients.” The two coefficient parameters will be labeled \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). All this notation is confusing, not least because different academic fields use inconsistent schemes. Follow the Cardinal Virtues and tackle your problem step by step.\nPerhaps more importantly, a focus on parameters is less relevant now than it was decades ago, when computational limitations made answering our actual questions harder. Parameters are imaginary. They don’t exist. They, in general, are not the answer to a real world question. They are tools, along with the models of which they are a part, we use to answer questions.\nPackages:\nThe primer.data package includes the trains data set. We use the brms package to build Bayesian models. (“brms” stands for Bayesian regression models.) The tidybayes packages makes working the fitted models easier. As usual, we use the tidyverse package.\nIn this chapter, we are going to ask a series of questions about the causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers on the attitude of US commuters toward immigration. These questions will pertain to all train commuters in the US today. For a refresher on this data, refer to Chapter 1.\nConsider:\nAnswering causal questions requires (at least) two potential outcomes: immigration attitudes when a person receives the treatment of being exposed to Spanish-speakers and immigration attitudes, for that same person, when they don’t receive the treatment. We can answer these and similar questions by creating a model with immigration attitude as the dependent variable and exposure to Spanish-speakers as the independent variable. Follow the four Cardinal Virtues: Wisdom, Justice, Courage and Temperance.\nWisdom requires the creation of a Preceptor Table, an examination of our data, and a determination, using the concept of “validity,” as to whether or not we can (reasonably!) assume that the two come from the same population.",

    "text": "6.1.1 Preceptor Table\nCausal or predictive model: In this case, the model is clearly causal, so our Preceptor Table will have two columns for the potential outcomes. If all you need to know to answer the question is the outcome under one value of the treatment, then the model is predictive, even if there is a treatment.\nOutcome: A person’s attitude toward immigration is the outcome.\nFor the questions that we have at hand we will be talking about all the adults in July 1, 2012 at the location of Chicago, Illinois which will allow us to answer the questions more accurately.\nUnits: Our units for this scenario would be individuals because the questions are about the attributes of unique people at the station. The question does not specify which individuals we are interested in, so assume it is adults in Chicago.\nTreatment: In any causal model, there is at least one covariate which is defined as the “treatment,” something which we can manipulate so that some units receive one version and other units get a different version. A “treatment” is just a covariate which we could manipulate, at least in theory. In this case, the treatment is exposure to Spanish-speakers. Units can either be exposed, i.e., they receive the “treatment,” or they can not be exposed, i.e., they receive the “control.”\nMoment in Time: We are interested in the causal effect today, in the year 2024.\nAgain, some of these details were not indicated in the original question. We almost always have to enage in a dialogue with whomever asked that question.\nOur Preceptor Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n\n\nID\n\nPotential Outcomes\n\n\nCovariate\n\n\n\nControl Ending Attitude\nTreated Ending Attitude\nTreatment\n\n\n\n\n1\n5*\n8\nYes\n\n\n2\n7\n4*\nNo\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n10\n3*\n5\nYes\n\n\n11\n10*\n7\nYes\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nN\n6\n13*\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarred values were not observed in the experiment. That is, Person 10 received the treatment and, afterwards, had a value of 5 for her attitude toward immigration. We don’t know — we can’t know — what her attitude would have been if she had received control instead. But, with the tools of inference, we can estimate what that value would have been if she had, in fact, received control.\nA Preceptor Table is the smallest possible table with rows and columns such that, if there is no missing data, all our questions are easy to answer. To answer questions about the average treatment effect, of exposing people to Spanish-speakers, on their attitudes toward immigration, we need a row for every adult in Chicago in 2024.\n\n6.1.2 Exploratory Data Analysis\nRecall the discussion from Chapter 1. Enos (2014) randomly placed Spanish-speaking confederates on nine train platforms around Boston, Massachusetts. The data that we want to analyze consists of the attitude toward immigration after the experiment is complete (att_end) and the exposure to Spanish-speakers (treatment) of each individual on these train platforms.\n\ntrains |&gt;\n  select(att_end, treatment)\n\n# A tibble: 115 × 2\n   att_end treatment\n     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;    \n 1      11 Treated  \n 2      10 Treated  \n 3       5 Treated  \n 4      11 Treated  \n 5       5 Control  \n 6      13 Treated  \n 7      13 Control  \n 8      11 Treated  \n 9      12 Control  \n10      10 Treated  \n# ℹ 105 more rows\n\n\nThe treatment can either be “Treated” or “Control” which are the two factors that may influence att_end. Participants were asked three questions about immigration issues, each of which allowed for an answer indicating strength of agreement on a scale form 1 to 5, with higher values for att_end indicating more agreement with conservative viewpoints.\n\ntrains |&gt;\n  select(att_end, treatment) |&gt;\n  summary()\n\n    att_end         treatment \n Min.   : 3.000   Control:64  \n 1st Qu.: 7.000   Treated:51  \n Median : 9.000               \n Mean   : 9.139               \n 3rd Qu.:11.000               \n Max.   :15.000               \n\n\nThe data include information about each respondent’s sex, political affiliations, age, income and so on. treatment indicates whether a subject was in the control or treatment group. The key outcome is their attitude toward immigration after the experiment: att_end.\nsummary() shows us what the different values of att_end and treatment are because it is a factor. The range for att_end seems reasonable.\n\nShow the codetrains |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = att_end, fill = treatment)) +\n    geom_bar(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n                   position = \"dodge\") +\n    labs(title = \"Ending Attitude Toward Immigration\",\n         subtitle = \"Treated Individuals Are More Conservative\",\n         x = \"Attitude\",\n         y = \"Probability\",\n         fill = NULL) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) + \n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen compared with individuals in the control group, the treated individuals seem more conservative.\n\n6.1.3 Validity\nValidity concerns the relationship between the columns in the Preceptor Table and the data. Are they similar enough that we can “stack” one on top of the other in order to create a Population Table?\natt_end, the outcome measure in our data is fairly clear measure of one’s attitude toward immigration. But is that exactly what we care about in the Chicago of 2024? Probably not. Politics in America has changed a great deal, not least with the Trump presidency. The phrases used in the 2012 survey do not mean the same thing today as they meant then. The aspects of immigration policy which we are most interested in have changed. But in a conflict between the data and the Preceptor Table, the latter must adjust because we can’t (easily) change the data.\ntreatment, the treatment variable in our data, involves Spanish-speakers on commuter train platforms. Is that what we are proposing to do in Chicago in 2024? Probably not! And, even if we actually attempted to use that treatment today, we would never be able to replicate it exactly, not just because we almost certainly could not get the same Spanish-speakers to come to Chicago. And, even if we did, they would be older, and different in other ways. Outside of scientific experiments, it is almost never the case that the treatment variable in the data will perfectly match the treatment variable in the Preceptor Table.\nAs always, we face a choice. We can either give up on the analysis — and this is often the correct decision! — or we can adjust the meaning of the columns in the Preceptor Table so that they are “close enough” to the data that validity holds. You won’t be surprised to see that we choose the option behind Door #2!\n\nUsing data from a 2012 survey of Boston-area commuters, we seek to measure the causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers on attitudes toward immigration among adults in Chicago and similar cities in 2024.",

    "text": "6.2 Justice\n\n\n\n\nJustice\n\n\n\nThe four concerns of Justice remain the same: the Population Table, stability, representativeness, and unconfoundedness.\n\n6.2.1 Population Table\nAfter assuming validity, we can now create our Population Table. Recall that every row from both the Preceptor Table and the data is included in the Population Table (at least at the start), along with all the rows from the underlying population from which we assume that both the Preceptor Table and the data were drawn. The Population Table includes rows from three sources: the Preceptor Table, the actual data, and all other members of the population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation Table\n\n\nSource\n\nPotential Outcomes\n\n\nCovariates\n\n\n\nControlled\nTreated\nTreatment\nYear\nCity\n\n\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nData\n2\n7*\nNo\n2012\nBoston, MA\n\n\nData\n10*\n6\nYes\n2012\nBoston, MA\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n…\n…\n…\n2024\nChicago, IL\n\n\nPreceptor Table\n…\n…\n…\n2024\nChicago, IL\n\n\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: the values that have a star next to them symbolize the possible values that may exist if they were “control” instead of “treated” or vice versa.\nOur year within the Population table is an example of the moment in time.\nOur actual data rows contain the information that we do know. These rows contain entries for both our covariates and the outcomes. In this case, the actual data comes from a study conducted on train commuters around Boston, MA in 2012, so our city entries for these rows will read “Boston, MA” and our year entries of these rows will read “2012”.\nDoes the Population Table have to include all the rows in the data? No! For example, if our question is just about attitudes toward immigration among men, we might delete all the rows with female respondents from the data before constructing the Population Table.\nEach row in the Population Table represents a unique ID/time combination. We rarely specify the Population Table exactly. For example, does the Population Table extend to 2010? Or 2050? Does it include Los Angeles? How about London? None of those questions have to be answered for us to make progress. As long as there is an underlying population from which we may assume that the rows in both the data and the Preceptor Table have been drawn, we can proceed.\n\n6.2.2 Stability\nIf the assumption of stability holds, then, first, the relationships between the columns in 2012 is the same as the relationships across the entire population and, second, that the same applies to the relationships between the columns in 2024.\nRecall the underlying logic of every data science analysis. We start wih data that was collected at a specific moment in time. We estimate a relationship between the variables, in this case between treatment and att_end. We then assume that this relationship holds beyond the time period of the data itself. First, we assume that the relationship holds across a larger time period than just the moment corresponding to our data gathering. Second, we then assume that this relationship also holds for the moment in time corresponding to our Preceptor Table.\nThe problem is that there are lots of reasons for thinking that stability does not hold in this case because US politics has changed so much since 2012, especially in regard to immigration. Immigration is much more salient now then it was then, so it is likely that the effect of the treatment might be very different today. However, if we don’t assume stability then we can’t use data from 2012 to inform our inferences about 2024. So, we assume it.\n\n6.2.3 Representativeness\nRepresentativeness, or the lack thereof, concerns two relationship, among the rows in the Population Table. The first is between the Preceptor Table and the other rows from that moment in time. The second is between our data and the other rows from that moment.\nStability looks across time periods. Representativeness looks within time periods.\nOur Preceptor Table is not a random draw from the underlying population today. We only care about Chicago (and not any other city). If the Preceptor Table is a random draw, then, by definition, it should be representative of the underlying population, at least within a given time period. Just because something is true across all cities in 2024 does not guarantee that it is true in Chicago. In fact, it is only true if Chicago is representative of the other 2024 rows from the population.\nA similar set of issues apply to our data. Ideally, our data would be a random sample from the underlying population in 2012. But it isn’t! We only have data from Boston, and not any other city. We need to assume that the rows we have from Boston are representive of the other rows in the population from 2012.\nThat assumption seems pretty extreme! For example, the survey respondents were all suburban commuters on train platforms. There are numerous ways in which such a sample is unrepresentative of both Boston adults as a whole, much less all the adults in other cities.\n\n6.2.4 Unconfoundedness\nUnconfoundedness means that the treatment assignment is independent of the potential outcomes, when we condition on pre-treatment covariates. A model is confounded if this is not true.\nSince treatment was assigned at random, we can be fairly confident that treatment assignment is idependent of everything. This is the beauty of randomization and the key reason why randomized control trials are the gold standard in statistics for drawing conclusions about causal effects.\nPutting these concerns together, we should add at least one sentence about these concerns to the analysis summary:\n\nUsing data from a 2012 survey of Boston-area commuters, we seek to measure the causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers on attitudes toward immigration among adults in Chicago and similar cities in 2024. There is some concern that the relationship has changed since our data was collected.\n\nIs that the only reasonable concern? No! There are always numerous problems with any data analysis because our assumptions are never true. Honesty compels us to highlight at least one such problem anytime we present our results. Which one to highlight and how to do so are matters of professional judgment.",

    "text": "6.3 Courage\n\n\n\n\nCourage\n\n\n\nJustice gave us the Population Table. Courage selects the data generating mechanism. We first specify the mathematical formula which connects the outcome variable we are interested in with the other data that we have. We explore different models. We need to decide which variables to include and to estimate the values of unknown parameters. We check our models for consistency with the data we have. We avoid hypothesis tests. We select one model.\nBecause the outcome variable is continuous, we use a standard regression model.\n\\[ y_i =  \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\epsilon_i \\]\nwith \\(\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\). \\(y_i\\) is the attitude toward immigration for person \\(i\\) after being exposed to the treatment or control. \\(x_i\\) corresponds to the treatment status for person \\(i\\). As we saw in the EDA above, treatment is a factor variable with two levels: “Treatment” and “Control.” Since English words don’t work in formulas, brm() will automatically transform treatment into a 0/1 variable named treatmentControl which will take on the value 1 if person \\(i\\) received control and 0 if they received treatment.\n\n6.3.1 Models\nWe create our fitted model in the usual way.\n\nfit_gauss &lt;- brm(formula = att_end ~ treatment,\n             data = trains,\n             family = gaussian(),\n             silent = 2,\n             refresh = 0,\n             seed = 9)\n\nBecause the default value of family is guassian(), we could have left out this part of the function call and gotten the same result. We add the seed argument to ensure that the fitted object is identical whenever we (or you) run this code. Recall that there is randomness in the modeling fitting process. This rarely affects the substantive results. But it is often convenient to be able to replicate a given model exactly. Using seed accomplishes this goal. The number 9 is arbitrary, other than being my lucky number. As usual, we use silent = 2 and refresh = 0 to turn off all the annoying messages.\n\nfit_gauss\n\n Family: gaussian \n  Links: mu = identity; sigma = identity \nFormula: att_end ~ treatment \n   Data: trains (Number of observations: 115) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nRegression Coefficients:\n                 Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept            8.45      0.35     7.75     9.13 1.00     4050     3185\ntreatmentTreated     1.54      0.53     0.52     2.57 1.00     3661     2977\n\nFurther Distributional Parameters:\n      Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nsigma     2.80      0.19     2.46     3.21 1.00     3874     2684\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS). For each parameter, Bulk_ESS\nand Tail_ESS are effective sample size measures, and Rhat is the potential\nscale reduction factor on split chains (at convergence, Rhat = 1).\n\n\nThe math for this model is exactly the same as the math for the predictive model in the first part of this chapter, although we change the notation a bit for clarity.\n\\[ attitude_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 control_i + \\epsilon_i\\]\nwhere \\[control_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\] \\[\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2)\\]\nNothing has changed, except for the meaning of the data items and the interpretations of the parameters. Let’s take a look at the parameters of the situation which plays a role alongside the mathematics to create the fitted model.\nOn the left-hand side we still have the outcome, \\(attitude_i\\), however in this case, this is a person’s attitude toward immigration after the experiment is complete. \\(attitude_i\\) takes on integer values between 3 and 15 inclusive. On the right-hand side, the part contained in the model will consist of the terms \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). For the most part, we don’t care about the values of parameters in our models. We care about the answers to our questions and the uncertainty associated therewith.\nBut in this simple model, the parameters also have a substantive interpretation. \\(\\beta_0\\) is also the average attitude toward immigration for treated individuals. \\(\\beta_1\\) is the difference between the attitude toward immigration for treated individuals — those exposed to Spanish-speakers — and the average attitude toward immigration for control individuals — those not exposed to Spanish-speakers. These are both our parameters. \\(control_i\\) is our explanatory variable and takes the value 0 or 1. In other words, this is a binary variable.The last part, \\(\\epsilon\\) (“epsilon”), represents the part that is not explained by our model and is called the error term. It is simply the difference between the outcome and our model predictions. In our particular case, this includes all factors that have an influence on someone’s attitude toward immigration but are not accounted for by treatment status. We assume that this error follows a normal distribution with an expected value of 0.\n\nNote that the formula applies to everyone in the population, not just the 115 people for whom we have data. This is what the stability assumption buys us. The index \\(i\\) does not just go from 1 through 115. It goes from 1 through \\(N\\), where \\(N\\) is the number of individuals in the population. Conceptually, everyone has an att_end under both treatment and under control, even we can only ever observe one of these.\nThe small \\(i\\)’s are an index for the data set. It is equivalent to the “ID” column in our Preceptor Table and simply states that the outcome for person \\(i\\) is explained by the predictor variables (\\(treatment_i\\) and \\(control_i\\)) for person \\(i\\), along with an error term.\n\n6.3.2 Testing\n\npp_check(fit_gauss)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur graph in the darker blue represents the actual data. As we can see with the lighter blue graph, our fitted model is able to generate a distribution of the data that is similar when compared to the actual data. However, the “fake-data” produces some values for att_end which are impossible. We know from the survey details that the lowest possible value for att_end is 3 and the highest is 15. But, with our “fake-data” simulations, we see several values that are less than 3 and great than 15. Consider:\n\npp_check(fit_gauss, type = \"hist\", bins = 12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgain, we see the problem. The true data is always within the range of 3 to 15. Our simulated (or “fake”) data sometimes strays outside this range, even if not very far and not very often. Is it a serious flaw? That is tough to decide.\nLet’s explore the issue by first changing treat_end from a continuous to an integer variable, which is probably more correct, and then re-estimate the model. Besides changing att_end to an integer, we also change the family to poisson() since this is the recommended model for dealing with “count” data\n\ntrains2 &lt;- trains |&gt; \n  mutate(att_end = as.integer(att_end))\n\nfit_poisson &lt;- brm(formula = att_end ~ treatment,\n                   data = trains2,\n                   family = poisson(),\n                   silent = 2,\n                   refresh = 0,\n                   seed = 9)\n\nBecause the poisson mode has a very different structure, the parameter estimates do not have a simple interpretation.\n\nfit_poisson\n\n Family: poisson \n  Links: mu = log \nFormula: att_end ~ treatment \n   Data: trains2 (Number of observations: 115) \n  Draws: 4 chains, each with iter = 2000; warmup = 1000; thin = 1;\n         total post-warmup draws = 4000\n\nRegression Coefficients:\n                 Estimate Est.Error l-95% CI u-95% CI Rhat Bulk_ESS Tail_ESS\nIntercept            2.13      0.04     2.05     2.21 1.00     3207     2605\ntreatmentTreated     0.17      0.06     0.05     0.29 1.00     3437     2632\n\nDraws were sampled using sampling(NUTS).

We still have predicted values that are below three or above 15, even though that is impossible. A common approach at this point would be to use the negative binomial family. We save that exercise for another day.\nThe purpose of the virtue of Courage is to create a data generating mechanism which is consistent with our understanding of how the world works and not-contradicted by he data which we have. Although there are some problems with fit_gauss, it is good enough for our purposes. So, the DGM looks like:\n\\[ attitude_i = 10 - 1.5  * control_i + \\epsilon_i\\]\nwhere \\[control_i \\in \\{0,1\\}\\] and \\[\\epsilon_i \\sim N(0, 2.8^2)\\].\n\n6.3.3 Data Generating Mechanism\nRecall the Preceptor Table and the units from the beginning. We are concerned with three main ideas from the Preceptor Table: our units (individuals at the train station), our outcome (individual’s attitude toward immigration) covariates (the treatment that each individual received).\nWith the help of the data generating mechanism that we have created from our fitted model we can fill in the missing values to the Preceptor Tables. We use the data generating mechanism as the last step of Courage as it allows us to analyze and view our fitted model’s data.\nAlthough we can review the posteriors of the parameters by looking at fit_gauss, it can bse useful to present the numbers in a formatted table.\n\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'future':\n  method               from      \n  all.equal.connection parallelly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristic\nBeta\n95% CI\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n8.4\n7.8, 9.1\n\n\ntreatment\n\n\n\n\n    Control\n—\n—\n\n\n    Treated\n1.5\n0.52, 2.6\n\n\n\nAbbreviation: CI = Credible Interval\n\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept) corresponds to 10.0 which is \\(\\beta_0\\). As always, R has, behind the scenes, estimated the entire posterior probability distribution for \\(\\beta_0\\). We are 95% confident that the true, but unknowable, average attitude toward immigration among the Treated in the population to be between 9.2 and 11. The posterior of \\(b_1\\), which is the coefficient of \\(control_i\\), is centered around -1.5 with a 95% confidence interval between -2.5 and -0,5.\nUp until now, we have used the Bayesian interpretation of “confidence interval.” This is also the intuitive meaning which, outside of academia, is almost universal. There is a truth out there. We don’t know, and sometimes can’t know, the truth. A confidence interval, and its associated confidence level, tells us how likely the truth is to lie within a specific range. If your boss asks you for a confidence interval, she almost certainly is using this interpretation.\nBut, in contemporary academic research, the phrase “confidence interval” is usually given a “Frequentist” interpretation. (The biggest divide in statistics is between Bayesians and Frequentists. The Frequentist approach, also known as “Classical” statistics, has been dominant for 100 years. Its power is fading, which is why this textbook is Bayesian.) For a Frequentist, a 95% confidence interval means that, if we were to apply the procedure we used in an infinite number of future situations like this, we would expect the true value to fall within the calculated confidence intervals 95% of the time. In academia, a distinction is sometimes made between confidence intervals (which use the Frequentist interpretation) and credible intervals (which use the Bayesian interpretation). We won’t worry about that difference in this Primer.\nWe can now add a sentence which describes our model to our summary of the entire project.\n\nUsing data from a 2012 survey of Boston-area commuters, we seek to measure the causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers on attitudes toward immigration among adults in Chicago and similar cities in 2024. There is some concern that the relationship has changed since our data was collected. We modeled att_end, a summary measure of attitude toward immigration measured on a 3 to 15 integer scale, as a linear function of treatment.\n\nObviously, a single extra sentence can only tell the reader so much. The important thing to note is that we are showing you a recipe for doing data science and for communicating your results. That communication will always include at least one sentence about the form of your model, the outcome variable and the covariates and/or treatments.",

We should be modest in the claims we make.\n\n6.4.1 Questions and Answers\nRecall the original question:\n\nWhat is the average treatment effect, of exposing people to Spanish-speakers, on their attitudes toward immigration?\n\nWe have already clarified that the question refers to residents of Chicago (and similar cities) in 2024.\nUse add_epred_draws() as usual. Creating the value for the newdata argument is tricky since we need to construct the treatment variable by hand. Even though treatment is a factor variable within trains, we can get away with using a simple character variable since either version would be transformed into a 0/1 variable by add_epred_draws().\n\nfit_gauss |&gt; \n  add_epred_draws(\n    newdata = tibble(treatment = c(\"Treated\", \"Control\")))\n\n# A tibble: 8,000 × 6\n# Groups:   treatment, .row [2]\n   treatment  .row .chain .iteration .draw .epred\n   &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;int&gt;  &lt;int&gt;      &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1 Treated       1     NA         NA     1   9.77\n 2 Treated       1     NA         NA     2  10.6 \n 3 Treated       1     NA         NA     3   9.52\n 4 Treated       1     NA         NA     4  10.1 \n 5 Treated       1     NA         NA     5   9.97\n 6 Treated       1     NA         NA     6  10.5 \n 7 Treated       1     NA         NA     7   9.96\n 8 Treated       1     NA         NA     8   9.91\n 9 Treated       1     NA         NA     9   8.36\n10 Treated       1     NA         NA    10   9.59\n# ℹ 7,990 more rows\n\n\nWe have 8,000 rows. The first four thousand rows are draws from the first row of newdata, meaning treatment equals \"Treated\". The next four thousand rows are draws for treatment = \"Control\". Mapping this tibble is easy because of its tidy structure.\n\nfit_gauss |&gt; \n  add_epred_draws(\n    newdata = tibble(treatment = c(\"Treated\", \"Control\"))) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = .epred, fill = treatment)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n                   bins = 100) +\n    labs(title = \"Posterior for Immigration Attitude Post Experiment\",\n         subtitle = \"Exposure to Spanish-speakers shifts immigration attitudes rightward\",\n         x = \"Attitude Toward Immigration\",\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust eyeballing the graph, we can see that the posterior att_end for Control is centered around 8.5. For Treated, the center is around 10. Since the causal effect is the difference between two outcomes, we can simply subtract and estimate that the causal effect is about \\(10 - 8.5 = 1.5\\).\nEven better, we can do the calculation on the individual rows of the posterior draws. But, first, we need to “widen” the tibble.\n\nfit_gauss |&gt; \n  add_epred_draws(\n    newdata = tibble(treatment = c(\"Treated\", \"Control\"))) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = .draw, names_from = treatment, values_from = .epred)\n\n# A tibble: 4,000 × 3\n   .draw Treated Control\n   &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n 1     1    9.77    8.27\n 2     2   10.6     8.83\n 3     3    9.52    7.87\n 4     4   10.1     8.23\n 5     5    9.97    8.57\n 6     6   10.5     8.62\n 7     7    9.96    8.60\n 8     8    9.91    8.31\n 9     9    8.36    8.23\n10    10    9.59    8.51\n# ℹ 3,990 more rows\n\n\nThe resulting table has only 4,000 rows because we have put the posteriors for Treated and Control next to each other. Recall that we can perform algebra on posteriors just as we do with numbers. That is, the easiest way to calculate the causal effect is to subtract the posterior for the outcome under Control from the posterior of the outcome under Treatment.\n\nfit_gauss |&gt; \n  add_epred_draws(\n    newdata = tibble(treatment = c(\"Treated\", \"Control\"))) |&gt; \n  pivot_wider(id_cols = .draw, names_from = treatment, values_from = .epred) |&gt; \n  mutate(causal_effect = Treated - Control) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x = causal_effect)) +\n    geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(count/sum(count))),\n                   bins = 100) +\n    labs(title = \"Posterior for Average Treatment Effect\",\n         subtitle = \"Exposure to Spanish-speakers shifts immigration attitudes rightward\",\n         x = \"Difference in Attitude\",\n         y = \"Probability\") +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n    theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe posterior of the average causal effect is centered around 1.5, with a 95% confidence from about 0.5 to 2.5. How big an effect is 1.5? The difference between Republican and Democratic attitudes toward immigration, before the experiment, was about 2.3.\n\ntrains |&gt; \n  summarize(mean(att_start), .by = party)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 2\n  party      `mean(att_start)`\n  &lt;chr&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Democrat                8.81\n2 Republican             11.1 \n\n\nSo the causal effect of hearing Spanish-speakers is about the same as 2/3s of the distance between Republicans and Democrats. This is not a small effect! To summarize our analysis:\n\nUsing data from a 2012 survey of Boston-area commuters, we seek to measure the causal effect of exposure to Spanish-speakers on attitudes toward immigration among adults in Chicago and similar cities in 2024. There is some concern that the relationship has changed since our data was collected. We modeled att_end, a summary measure of attitude toward immigration measured on a 3 to 15 integer scale, as a linear function of treatment. The average causal effect of treatment was about 1.5, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.5 to 2.5. Hearing Spanish-speakers made people more conservative with regard to immigration. That 1.5 effect is about 2/3s of the distance between the average attitudes toward immigration of Republicans versus Democrats.\n\n\n6.4.2 Humility\nWe can never know the truth.\nWe need to maintain humility when we are making our inferences and decisions.

    "text": "Project Set Up\nYou will need to do the below steps at least one time. It is more likely, however, that you will do them dozens of times. If things are working, great! If they start not working, you can try to diagnose the problem. But, if you can’t, then you are in a nuke it from orbit scenario, which means that you start by deleting the current version of the package from two places: your computer and your Github account. To delete a project from your computer, put the R Studio project directory in the Trash. Make sure to also close out of the R Studio session after you delete it. If for some reason you cannot completely remove it, consider using the command $sudo rm -r dirname where you replace dirname with the path to the project on your computer. sudo and rm can be extremely dangerous when used together, so make sure to double check the command and/or do additional research. After you successfully remove the R project from your computer, go to your Github account and then go to Settings to delete the repo.\nKey steps:\n\nFork/download the target repo:\n\n\nlibrary(usethis)  \ncreate_from_github(repo_spec = \"PPBDS/INSERT-NAME-OF-PROJECT\",   \n                   fork = TRUE,   \n                   destdir = \"/Users/davidkane/Desktop/projects/\",   \n                   protocol = \"https\")  \n\nObviously, you need to modify the string “INSERT-NAME-OF-PROJECT” to correspond to one of our projects. Most common options are r4ds.tutorials, primer, primer.data, and primer.tutorials. If, for some reason, you are working on a project which does not reside in the PPBDS organization, you should modify the first part of the repo_spec as well.\nYou must change destdir to be a location on your computer. Indeed, professionals will generally have several different RStudio sessions open, each working on a different R project/package, each of which is connected to its own Github repo.\nFor your education, it is worth reading the help page for create_from_github(). The fork and protocal arguments may not really be necessary and, obviously, you should place the project in the location on your computer in which your other projects live. The command first forks a copy of PPBDS/primer to your Github account and then clone/downloads that fork to your computer.\nThis may seem like overkill, but, as Pro Git explains, it is how (essentially) all large projects are organized. With luck, you only have to issue this command once. After that, you are always connected, both to your fork and to the true repos, which live at github/com/PPBDS. Also, note that, if something ever gets totally messed up on your computer, you can just delete the project folder on your computer and the repo on your Github account and then start again. (If you have made changes that you don’t want to lose, just save the files with those changes to one side and then move them back after you have recreated the project.)\nNote that this command should automatically put you in a new RStudio session with the primer (or primer.tutorials or primer.data) RStudio project which resides on your computer\n\nThe next step is to get renv setup so that you are running the same package versions as everyone else. Run this once:\n\n\nlibrary(renv)\nrenv::restore()\n\nThis will install all the packages you need in the directory of this project. If this command fails, most commonly with a report about problems with compiling a specific package, notify me right away. If I update the renv.lock file by using renv::update(), the problem will often go away. See the Common Problems section below for further discussion.\nrenv::restore() has no effect on your main library of R packages. Restart your R session. Again, this means that you now have two separate installations of, for example, ggplot2. One is in the default place which your R sessions is by default pointed to. (In a different project without a renv directory, you can run .libPaths() to see where that is.) The second place that ggplot2 is installed is in the renv directory associated with this project.\nNote that, for the most part, you won’t do anything with renv after this initial use. If you use error = TRUE in any code chunk, you will also need renv.ignore = TRUE in that code chunk, or you will get an annoying warning because renv can’t parse the code in that chunk.\nHowever, there are three other renv commands you might issue:\nrenv::status() just reports if anything is messed up. It won’t hurt anything.\nrenv::restore() looks at the renv.lock file and installs the packages it specifies. You will need to do this when I make a change to renv.lock, e.g., if I upgrade our version of ggplot2 or add a new package.\nrenv::snapshot() should only be issued if you know what you are doing. This changes the renv.lock file, which is something that, usually, only I do. Most common case for use would be if you need to add a new package to the project.\nWarning: The renv package commands are very sensitive to your current working directory. Ensure that you are in the main directory of your project — something like /Users/dkane/Desktop/projects/primer.tutorials — before you run any of them.\n\nCreate a branch to work from:\n\n\npr_init(branch = \"chapter-9\")\n\nMake sure the branch name is sensible. Again, this is a command that you only need to issue once, at least for our current workflow. You should always be “on” this branch, never on the default (master) branch. You can check this in the upper right corner of the git panel on R Studio.\nIn more professional settings, you will often work on several different branches at once. So, if you are comfortable, you should feel free to create more than one branch, use it, delete it and so on. Never work on the default branch, however. And, if you use multiple branches, be careful where you are and what you are doing.",

This is how you make sure that your repo and your computer is updated with the latest changes that have been made in the book. The word “upstream” is associated with the repos at PPBDS. The word “origin” is associated with the fork at your Github account. But, in general, you don’t need to worry about this. Just pull every time you sit down.

And so on.\n\nAt some point, you will be ready to push to the PPBDS organization. However, you can’t do this directly. Instead, you must submit a pull request (PR). Because you are part of a larger project, these commands are slightly different than what you have done before, which has usually just been clicking on the pull (blue) and push (green) arrows in the Git pane in RStudio.\n\nIssue pull requests every few days, depending on how much work you have done and/or whether other people are waiting for something you have done.\n\n\npr_push()\n\nThis command bundles up a bunch of git commands (which you could do by hand) into one handy step. This command does everything needed to create a “pull request” — a request from you to me that I accept the changes you are proposing into the repo at PPBDS/primer — and then opens up the web page to show you. But you are not done! You must PRESS the green button on that web page, sometimes twice. Until then, the PR has not actually been created. pr_push() just does everything before that. The “pr” in pr_push() stands for pull request.\n\nI will leave aside for now issues associated with the back-and-forth discussions we might have around your pull request. I will probably just accept it. Your changes will go into the repos at PPBDS and then be distributed to everyone else when they run pr_merge_main().\nYou can now continue on. There is no need to wait for me to deal with your pull request. There is no need to fork/clone/download again. You don’t need to create a new branch, although many people do, with a branch name which describes what they are working on now. You just keep editing your files, knitting, and committing then pushing to your forked repo. When you feel you have completed another chunk of work, just run pr_push() again.\nRead the usethis setup help page at least once, perhaps after a week or two of working within this framework. It has lots of good stuff!",

    "text": "Common Problems\n\n\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of this creation process, the blue/green arrows (in the Git panel) for pulling/pushing may be grayed out. This is a sign that the connection between your computer and your forked repo has not “settled in.” (I am not sure of the cause or even if this is the right terminology.) I think that just issuing your first pr_merge_main() fixes it. If not, it always goes away. Until it does, however, you can’t pull/push to your repo. That doesn’t really matter, however, since the key commands you need are pr_merge_main() and pr_push(), both of which always work immediately.\nAfter running pr_merge_main(), you will often see a bunch of files in your Git tab in the top right corner of Rstudio marked with an M (for Modified), including files which you know you did not edit. These are the files that have been updated on the “truth” — on PPBDS/primer, for example — since your last pr_merge_main(). Since you pulled them directly from the PPBDS/primer repo, your forked repo sees all the changes other people have made and thinks that you made them. This is easily fixed, however — just commit all the changes to your forked repo. (Strangely, this seems to not always happen. If you don’t see this effect, don’t worry.)\nAlways run pr_merge_main() before committing a file. Otherwise, you may create lots of merge conflicts. If this happens, save a copy of the file(s) you personally were editing off to the side. Then, nuke it from orbit, following the instructions above. Repeat the Project Set Up process. Then move in your file(s) by hand into the new repo, and commit/push them as normal.\nWhen you submit a pull request to merge your work with the PPBDS repo, it won’t always be smiles and sunshine — every once in a while, you’ll run into merge conflicts. When these arise, it is because two parties work on a file separately and submit conflicting changes. This makes it hard for GitHub to “merge” your version with the other version. When this happens, find multiple adjacent “&gt;”, “&lt;”, and “=” signs in your document — these will show you where the conflicts occur. For more background on merge conflicts, read this.\n\nIf you see the above-mentioned conflicts in your document, do not submit a pull request. This will mess things up. Instead, first, go through your document, and make sure all the weird conflict indicators (&lt;, &gt;, and =) are removed. Second, decide what goes in that space. It might be the stuff you wrote. It might be the other stuff. It might be some combination of the two which you decide on. Whatever happens, you are making an affirmative choice about what should appear in the file at that location. Once all the merge conflicts are fixed, run pr_push() again.\n\n\npr_push() can be tricky. First, note that, if I have not accepted a (p)ull (r)equest which you have submitted, then your PR is still open. You can see it on Github. In fact, you can see all the closed/completed pull requests as well. If, while one PR is still open, you submit another pr_push(), then this will just be added to your current PR. And that is OK! We don’t need it to be separate.\n\nBut even if there is not an open PR, pr_push() can be tricky. The key thing to remember is that you must press a green button on Github for a new PR to be created. Normally, this is easy. Running pr_push() automatically (or perhaps after you run pr_view()) puts you in a browser and brings you to the correct Github page. Press the button and – presto! – you have created a PR. But, sometimes, the web page is different. It actually sends you back to an old pull request. When this happens, you need to click on the “Pull Request” tab above. This will take you to a new page, with a green button labeled “Compare & Pull Request”. Press that button.\n\nIf you end up needing to install a new package — which should be rare — just install it with renv::install()and then type renv::status() to confirm than renv is aware of the change. Then, type renv::snapshot(). This will update the renv.lock file to include the new package. You just commit/push the new version of renv.lock, and that shares the information with everyone else on the project. Never commit/push a modified renv.lock unless you know why it has changed. But, for the most part, leave changes in renv.lock to me.\nBe careful of committing garbage files like “.DS_Store”, which is a file created sometimes. Only commit changes which you understand. In the vast majority of cases your PRs will only involve one or two files.\nIf using Windows, make sure you have RTools installed.\nSometimes, your renv library becomes messed up. Note that nuking from orbit may not fix this because renv installs your packages in some private common area which is not impacted when you reinstall the PPBDS package you are working with. In this case, running renv::rebuild() may help. If not, run renv::diagnostics(), find the path to the renv cache directory and delete everything there by hand. Then, run renv::repair()'.\nWhen using renv::restore(), you will occasionally have a problem in which one package, say aprob, fails to install, thereby aborting the entire run. This can be tricky. The most common reason for this problem is that the renv.lock file specifies an older version of aprob than the current version available on CRAN. Since CRAN does not (?) keep binaries for non-current versions, your computer is forced to compile from source. This often works OK, especially if you are using a Mac. But it often doesn’t work. The easiest approach is to update the renv.lock file to use the latest version of aprob.\n\nComplications can also arise if aprob was, in the last day or two, updated on CRAN. If you go to the page for aprob you can see that the source file is version 1.2.7, or whatever, while the binary versions are still 1.2.6. It takes a day or two for new binaries to be created on CRAN, especially for Windows. Again, situations like this are tricky enough that you should reach out to me for guidance.",

Chapter titles are in title case. Headings do not end with a period.\nNever hard code stuff like “A tibble with 336,776 rows and 19 columns.” What happens when you update the data? Instead, calculate all numbers on the fly, with “r scales::comma(x)” whenever x is a number in the thousands or greater. Example: “A tibble with ‘r scales::comma(nrow(x))’ rows and ‘r ncol(x)’ columns.”\n“We” are writing this book.\nPackage names are in bold: ggplot2 is a package for doing graphics. In general, we reserve bolding for package names. Use italics for emphasis in other contexts.\nR code, anything you might type in the console, is always within backticks. Example: mtcars is a built-in data set.\nFunction names always include the parentheses: we write pivot_wider(), not pivot_wider.\nAdd lots of memes and videos and cartoons.\nMake ample use of comments, placed with the handy Command/Ctrl + Shift + / shortcut. These are notes for everyone else working on the chapter, and for future you.\nAll tables should be created with the gt package.\nAll images and gifs are loaded with knitr::include_graphics().\nInterim data sets should be called x or something sensible to the situation, like ch7 for a data set you are working with in Chapter 7. Do not use names like data and df, both of which are R commands.\nStudents are sometimes tentative. Don’t be! Edit aggressively. If you don’t like what is there, delete it. (If I disagree with your decision, I can always get the text back from Github.) Move things around. Make the chapter yours, while keeping to the style of the other chapters. Note that 90% of the prose here was not written by me. Cut anything you don’t like.\nIf you make an mp4, you can convert it to .gif using https://convertio.co/mp4-gif.\nEverything is Bayesian. The confidence interval for a regression means that there is a 95% chance that the true value lies within that interval. Use Rubin Causal Model and potential outcomes to define precisely what “true value” you are talking about. And so on.",

    "text": "Comments\nMuch of this material comes from the Tidyverse Style Guide. In extremis, you might go against this advice, if you should add a code comment in your work explaining your decision to do so.\nInclude comments in your code. Easy-to-understand chunks of code should not have comments. The code is the comment. But other code will merit many, many lines of comments, more lines than the code itself. In a given file, you should have about as many total lines of comments as you have lines of code.\nMake your comments meaningful. They should not be a simple description of what your code does. The best comments are descriptions about why you did what you did and which other approaches you tried or considered. (The code already tells us what you did.) Good comments often have a “Dear Diary” quality: “I did this. Then I tried that. I finally chose this other thing because of reasons X, Y and Z. If I work on this again, I should look into this other approach.” Because of this, the structure is often a paragraph of comments followed by several lines of code.\nEach line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol (a “hash”) followed by a single space: #. Code comments must be separated from code by one empty line on both sides. Format your code comments neatly. Place your cursor in the comment block and hit Ctrl-Shift-/ to format the comment automatically. label your R code chunks, without using weird characters or spaces. download_data is a good R code chunk label. Plot #1 is not.\nSpelling matters. Comments should be constructed as sentences, with appropriate capitalization and punctuation.",

A message/warning/error is worth understanding and then fixing. Don’t close your eyes (metaphorically) and pretend that the problem doesn’t exist. There are some situations, however, in which, no matter what you try, you can’t fix the problem. In those few cases, you can use one of these hacks, but you must make a code comment directly below it, explaining the situation.
